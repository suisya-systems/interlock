"""End-to-end contract: broker detection -> attention notification (Issue #167).

Every other test in this file's neighbourhood stubs one side of the
seam. This one does not: it drives a **real** :class:`Broker` into the
double-claimer condition, then reads the journal it actually wrote with
the attention reader and classifies the result.

That is the regression this issue exists to prevent. Detection has been
in ``store.py`` since Issue #125 and was correct the whole time — it just
had no consumer, so an operator learned about a double sidecar by
noticing that reports had stopped arriving. A rename of the journal
event or of its ``owner`` / ``instances`` fields would silently restore
exactly that state; the unit tests on either side would stay green.
