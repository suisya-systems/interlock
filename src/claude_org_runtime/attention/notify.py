"""Render and dispatch attention notifications.

Pipeline per event:

1. Pick a template (config override → bundled English default).
2. Detect unknown placeholders (outside §6 allowlist) and fall back to
   the bundled default if any are present — the watcher must not
   crash on a misspelled template per §6 acceptance criteria.
3. Truncate to ``max_title_chars`` / ``max_body_chars``.
4. Emit a stdout log line (always — including ``--dry-run``).
5. If desktop output is enabled and not dry-run, run the backend
   subprocess with a small timeout. If that fails / no backend is
   available, fall through to a terminal bell when sound applies.

Sub-process invocation:
* Never shells out via ``shell=True``.
* Times out at :data:`_SUBPROCESS_TIMEOUT_SEC` seconds.
* Strips control characters from title/body before composing arguments.
