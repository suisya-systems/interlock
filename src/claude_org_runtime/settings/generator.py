"""Schema-driven worker ``.claude/settings.local.json`` generator.

Port of claude-org-ja ``tools/generate_worker_settings.py``. The schema
SoT (``role_configs_schema.json``) now ships inside this package, so
consumers no longer need to keep their copy under ``tools/`` in sync;
they install ``claude-org-runtime`` and invoke this module.

CLI parity with the in-tree script is preserved -- the ``--role`` /
``--worker-dir`` / ``--claude-org-path`` / ``--out`` / ``--schema``
arguments behave identically. ``--schema`` defaults to the bundled
schema instead of ``<repo>/tools/role_configs_schema.json``.

Phase 3 case E (Issue #392) adds an optional ``sandbox`` object on
``worker_roles.<role>`` plus Layer 3 suppression. See
``role_configs_schema.json`` ``worker_roles.$comment_sandbox`` for the
shape; rendered output and suppression metadata are surfaced via
``claude-org-runtime settings show --explain``.

Phase 1 (Refs `claude-org-ja#378`) extends the renderer with:

- ``role_kind='org'|'worker'`` so the same ``render_role_with_metadata``
  call site can render org roles (``schema['roles'][...]``) in
  addition to worker roles (``schema['worker_roles'][...]``).
- A structured anchor entry shape on ``sandbox.filesystem.deny{Read,Write}``
  (``{anchor, path, suppressOnSymlinkEscape}``) plus a backward-compat
  legacy adapter for raw strings; see
  ``role_configs_schema.json`` ``worker_roles.$comment_sandbox_anchor``.
- A Pattern B context (``base_clone`` / ``task_id`` / ``branch_ref``)
  whose placeholders are substituted alongside ``{worker_dir}`` /
  ``{claude_org_path}`` in entry paths and ``additionalDirectories``.

Phase 1 (Refs `claude-org-runtime#13`) adds Pattern A/B/C-aware sandbox
selection on worker roles:

- ``worker_roles[<role>].sandbox_by_pattern: {A?, B?, C?}`` declares
  one sandbox surface per Pattern. ``sandbox`` and
  ``sandbox_by_pattern`` are mutually exclusive on worker roles.
- ``--pattern A|B|C`` selects which entry the renderer treats as the
  role's sandbox; missing pattern keys are an authoring error rather
  than a silent fallthrough.
- ``anchor='base_clone'`` resolves to ``ctx.base_clone`` so Pattern B
  entries can reference Git metadata under
  ``<base_clone>/.git/worktrees/<task_id>``,
  ``<base_clone>/.git/objects``, etc. (the SoT is claude-org-ja's
  ``docs/contracts/role-pattern-sandbox-contract.md`` §4.2.1; this
  runtime repo intentionally does not redistribute the contract).
- Org roles (``roles[<role>]``: secretary / dispatcher / curator)
  keep the single ``sandbox`` shape and may not declare
  ``sandbox_by_pattern`` -- there is no role × pattern axis on the
  org side.

NOTE: This runtime PR only exposes the schema + renderer surface.
The paired claude-org-ja PR (Phase 1 PR4) updates
``tools/resolve_worker_layout.py`` / ``tools/gen_delegate_payload.py``
to plumb ``--pattern`` / ``--base-clone`` / ``--task-id`` /
``--branch-ref`` through the dispatch path, lands the concrete
``worker_roles[*].sandbox_by_pattern`` bodies, and updates
``tools/check_runtime_schema_drift.py`` to render A/B/C fixtures.
Pattern B's *command-isolation* guardrails (``Bash(git worktree *)``
deny + ``block-dangerous-git.sh``) are also a ja-side concern --
this runtime only encodes the *path-isolation* layer in
``sandbox_by_pattern.B``.

# bwrap symlink canonicalization (Refs `claude-org-runtime#sandbox-symlink`)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Claude Code merges *both* ``sandbox.filesystem.deny{Read,Write}`` (Layer 3)
# and the path-shaped ``permissions.deny`` rules (Layer 2 ``Read(...)`` /
# ``Edit(...)``) into the single deny set it hands to bubblewrap -- see
# https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sandboxing ("Paths from both
# sandbox.filesystem settings and permission rules are merged together into
# the final sandbox configuration").
#
# bwrap materializes one mount point per deny path inside a staging newroot
# *before* the pivot. An **absolute** symlink anywhere in a deny path's
# component chain resolves against that staging root, where the target does
# not exist yet, so mount-point creation fails with ENOENT and bwrap aborts
# the entire launch:
#
#     bwrap: Can't create file at /home/<user>/.aws/config: No such file or
#     directory
#
# The launch failure is not fail-closed: Claude Code's documented escape
# hatch then retries the command with ``dangerouslyDisableSandbox``, so every
# subsequent Bash command runs unsandboxed. On WSL2 this fires whenever a
# credential directory is a symlink into ``/mnt/c`` (a very common setup).
#
# Empirically established on WSL2 (bubblewrap 0.6.1):
#
# - absolute symlink in the chain -> bwrap aborts (both for a path *under*
#   the link and for the link itself)
# - *relative* symlink in the chain -> fine (resolves inside the staging tree)
# - the fully realpath'd form -> fine, even when it lands in ``/mnt/c``
# - unanchored globs (``**/credentials*``) -> fine; Claude Code never expands
#   them into concrete host paths for the deny set
#
# So the fix is to rewrite an escaping deny path to its realpath rather than
# drop it: the deny survives, and bwrap can bind it. Rewriting does not
# weaken the Layer 2 tool-level block either -- Claude Code resolves symlinks
# when matching ``Read`` / ``Edit`` deny rules, so the realpath form still
# blocks reads issued through the original symlinked path.

# Layer 2 tools whose argument is a filesystem path. ``Read`` / ``Edit`` are
# the pair Claude Code's sandbox docs name as contributing to the deny set;
# ``Write`` is included because this repo's own schema and docs treat it as a
# Layer 2 filesystem deny (``role_configs_schema.json`` ships
# ``Write(*/workers/*/...)`` entries). Canonicalizing a rule that turns out
# not to reach bwrap is harmless -- the realpath form denies the same files,
# since path matching resolves symlinks -- whereas omitting one that does
# reach it leaves the sandbox-launch failure in place.

    Walks ``path`` root-downwards and reports the first prefix that is a

    Only absolute links are reported because relative links resolve
    correctly inside bwrap's staging newroot (see the module note above).

    Non-absolute inputs return ``None`` -- a project-relative deny path
    is not a concrete host path, so it never reaches bwrap as one.

    The walk emulates kernel path resolution rather than inspecting the
    literal components, because two textual shortcuts both produce false
    negatives that were verified to still abort bwrap:

    - ``normpath`` collapses ``link/..`` and would erase the very
      component to inspect, so ``/home/u/link/../x`` would look clean.
      Hence ``..`` is applied to the *resolved* prefix as we go.
    - a **relative** link may point at an **absolute** one
      (``rel -> abs`` where ``abs -> /mnt/c/...``). Checking only each
      literal component's immediate target would clear ``rel`` and never
      look at ``abs``. Hence relative targets are spliced into the
      remaining components and the walk continues through them.

    ``max_links`` bounds symlink-loop resolution the way the kernel's
    ``ELOOP`` limit does; hitting it returns ``None`` so a pathological
    entry is passed through untouched instead of hanging.

    The walk starts from the path's *anchor* rather than from ``os.sep``.
    On Windows ``os.path.join('\\\\', 'C:')`` yields the drive-relative
    ``'C:'``, which would silently rebase every subsequent component and

    there is the bug this normalization fixes -- it made ``/doctor``

    A kept structured-dict entry is resolved to its concrete absolute

    and a *suppressed* entry still surfaces its anchor in the ``$comment``
    note via :func:`_format_entry_for_comment`. The internal model
    (suppression metadata, schema input) keeps the dict untouched.

    - Malformed structured entries with no concrete absolute rendering
