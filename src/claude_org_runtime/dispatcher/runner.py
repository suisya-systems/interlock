"""Dispatcher state-machine helper for claude-org (port of `tools/dispatcher_runner.py`).

This module is the runtime port of the in-tree
``tools/dispatcher_runner.py`` helper from claude-org-ja. It computes the
deterministic parts of the Dispatcher delegation state machine (balanced
split target selection, name/cwd validation, instruction-template
rendering, worker seed + outbox file writes) and emits a JSON action plan
that Dispatcher Claude reads and executes via MCP tool calls.

The helper does NOT call MCP tools directly. Dispatcher remains the actor
that receives Secretary's DELEGATE, invokes this helper, reads the
returned plan, and performs the ``spawn_claude_pane`` / ``send_keys`` /
``send_message`` / etc. calls.

Behaviour parity with the original ``tools/dispatcher_runner.py`` is a
hard requirement -- claude-org-ja consumers can replace their in-tree
script with ``python -m claude_org_runtime.dispatcher.runner`` without
regression. The only surface change is the new ``--template-repo`` flag,
which lets the caller point the helper at an arbitrary repo root that
hosts the ``.claude/skills/org-delegate/references/instruction-template.md``
auto-expand template (default: current working directory, which matches
how the in-tree script was invoked from the claude-org-ja repo root).

Usage::

    python -m claude_org_runtime.dispatcher.runner delegate-plan \\
        --task-json .state/dispatcher/inbox/{task_id}.json \\
        --panes-json panes.json \\
        --template-repo /path/to/claude-org-ja

The capacity model is backend-aware (runtime Issue #99). Under ``--transport
renga`` (the geometry backend) the rect-based balanced split derives both the
spawn target and the concurrent-worker ceiling. Under ``--transport broker``
(independent detached sessions, no shared tab geometry) the rect ceiling is
replaced by an explicit ``--max-concurrent-workers`` policy and the spawn
addresses a stable adapter-resolvable target. The ``split_capacity_exceeded``
status is kept for both backends; only the escalation reason differs.

renga 2.0 (runtime Issue #158) scopes ``list_panes`` to the CALLER's tab, so
the pane snapshot stopped being a census of the org. The population source is
therefore split off into an optional ``--peers-json`` (``list_peers``, which
spans every tab), while ``--panes-json`` stays the geometry source that the
balanced split ranks. Optional ``--tab`` / ``--overflow-to-new-tab`` place a
worker in another tab; both fail closed unless the caller asserts
``--server-capability spawn_tab``. Every one of those inputs is optional and
omitting them reproduces the pre-#158 numbers and plan shape exactly.

Exit codes:
  0 -- plan emitted OK (status = ``ready_to_spawn``)
  1 -- input validation failed (status = ``input_invalid``)
  2 -- capacity exhausted and escalation is required
       (status = ``split_capacity_exceeded``): renga = no rect balanced-split
       candidate; broker = max_concurrent_workers reached

These three are the only process exit codes. The renga tab error codes
(``tab_not_found`` / ``tab_ambiguous`` / ``tab_limit_reached`` /
``target_tab_mismatch``) are PLAN-level: they lead the relevant ``errors[]``
or escalation string and key ``plan.on_spawn_error``, but never become an
exit status -- consumers branch on 0/1/2 and would misread a fourth value.

#
# These mirror renga's own layout constants so escalation copy can *name* the
# panels that are eating the frame. They must NEVER be subtracted from a
# ``Pane`` rect, and no capacity comparison may take one as an operand.
#
# Why: renga carves the org sidebar, the file tree and a swapped preview off
# the frame BEFORE the pane layout runs -- ``layout_geometry::compute`` does
# ``pane_w = width - org_w - tree_w - preview_w`` and advances the pane area's
# origin past each panel (renga src/app/layout_geometry.rs:143-176). That
# ``layout.panes`` Rect is the only thing ever handed to
# ``LayoutNode::calculate_rects``, whose output becomes ``last_pane_rects``,
# which ``pane_infos_for_workspace`` copies verbatim onto the wire
# (app_core.rs:387-427 -> ipc_handlers.rs:193-214). So every rect this module
# receives is FRAME-ABSOLUTE and already net of the sidebar: ``x`` includes the
# offset and ``width`` is the post-carve remainder. Subtracting a sidebar width
# here would be a straight double subtraction, and worse it would DESYNC this
# module's prediction from renga's own split guard (layout_ops.rs:244-263,
# ``rect.width / 2 < min_pane_width``), which judges the very same rects --
# manufacturing split_capacity_exceeded on layouts renga would happily split.

# gates internally and only surfaces an ``[server_too_old] ...`` error. So

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The rect-based balanced split (choose_split) derives *both* the spawn
# target/direction *and* the implicit concurrent-worker ceiling from renga's
# "one terminal tab tiled across every pane" geometry: once no child clears
# the MIN_PANE_* floors, choose_split returns no candidate and build_plan
# raises ``split_capacity_exceeded``. That geometry ceiling is a real physical
# constraint under renga but has *no* physical basis under the broker
# transport, where every pane is an independent detached session with its own
# terminal size -- a broker pane's geometry says nothing about how many more
# workers the operator can usefully run.
#
# So capacity is made backend-aware: the renga path keeps the rect ceiling
# unchanged, while the broker path replaces it with an explicit
# ``max_concurrent_workers`` policy (:class:`CapacityPolicy`). The transport is
# passed in explicitly by the caller (``build_plan(..., transport=...)`` / CLI
# ``--transport``); it is NEVER inferred from the ``list_panes`` snapshot shape,
# because the broker's logical-pane ``w=h=0`` sentinel is retained for
# duplicate detection and spawned broker panes carry real session sizes, so a
# "0 => broker, positive => renga" heuristic would break the moment a worker is
# live (design-review Blocker).

# Values accepted for the ``transport`` selector. These three literals plus the

# Multi-tab population / geometry / placement (runtime #158, renga 2.0)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# renga 2.0 (renga#287-#291) turned one window into many tabs and scoped
# ``list_panes`` to the CALLER's tab, which broke the one assumption every
# capacity number in this module rested on: "the pane snapshot is the whole
# org". A dispatcher in tab 0 counting worker panes now misses every worker in
# tabs 1..N and happily spawns past the ceiling.
#
# The fix splits the two jobs the ``panes`` argument used to do:
#
#   * ``panes`` stays the GEOMETRY source. It is the only input carrying rects,
#     it is caller-tab-scoped, and it is what ``choose_split`` ranks. Unchanged.
#   * ``peers`` becomes the POPULATION / IDENTITY source. renga's ``list_peers``
#     spans every tab on 2.0 and is already caller-tab-only on 1.4, so counting
#     worker peers yields the org-wide number on 2.0 and the caller-tab number
#     on 1.4 -- correct on both WITHOUT knowing which one is on the wire. That
#     is why the count needs no capability token (see :func:`derive_tab_awareness`
#     for the three things that DO need one).
#
# Everything below is additive. ``choose_split`` / ``_split_options`` / ``Pane``
# / ``SplitChoice`` are deliberately untouched, and the sidebar constants above
# appear in exactly one place in this section -- inside
# :func:`explain_left_panels` -- so no arithmetic can ever double-subtract them.

    Closes the one hole the pane/peer union cannot close on its own, and it

    The union is what makes a *same-tab* spawn safe across the peer-bind
    delay: the new pane shows up in the caller's ``list_panes`` immediately,
    so it is counted from the moment it exists even though its peer bind is
    still 10-30s away (this module's own ``after_spawn`` step waits up to
    ~30s for that bind). An OVERFLOW spawn has no such cover. It lands in a
    tab of its own, which renga#288 scoping keeps out of the caller's
    ``list_panes`` forever, and it is not a peer yet -- so for the length of
    that window it is invisible to both inputs, and back-to-back delegations
    each re-observe the same census and each admit another worker. Measured
    on the pre-fix build: a ceiling of 2 admitted three workers, every plan
    reporting ``free_worker_slots: 2``.

    The reservation ledger is the seed file the helper itself already writes
    on ``ready_to_spawn`` (:func:`write_worker_seed`, ``Status: planned``).
    Reading it is not a new kind of impurity: ``build_plan`` already stats
    these exact paths for the duplicate-state-file guard.

    Three rules keep the ledger honest:

    - **Excluded if already counted.** A worker that has since become a pane
      or a peer is in ``counted_names`` and must not be added twice.
    - **Excluded if the seed says it is no longer pending.** The seed carries
      a ``Status:`` line, and the runtime writes ``planned`` into it. A
      consumer's monitoring loop rewrites these same files as the worker
      progresses -- which also refreshes the mtime -- so a worker that just
      finished would otherwise hold a slot for the whole window and block its
      own replacement. An explicit status other than ``planned`` is direct
      evidence the spawn is no longer pending, and it beats the mtime clock.
      An unreadable or status-less seed falls back to the clock: guessing
      "still pending" over-counts, which refuses a spawn, while guessing the
      other way exceeds the only ceiling this mode has.
    - **Expired by mtime.** Nothing ever deletes a seed file, so counting
      them unconditionally would make every worker the org has ever planned
      consume a slot forever. A reservation is only credible while the bind
      it is waiting for is still plausible, hence
      :data:`WORKER_BIND_WINDOW_SECONDS`. That also makes the ledger
      self-healing: a spawn that failed outright -- leaving a seed nothing
      will ever rewrite -- frees its slot once the window passes, with no
      cleanup step and no operator action.

    pre-#158 plan is byte-unchanged.

    ``remove_state_writes`` names a concrete lockout rather than being
    advice: ``cmd_delegate_plan`` writes the worker seed and the instruction
    file as soon as the status is ``ready_to_spawn``, and :func:`build_plan`
    hard-fails when either already exists. A tab spawn that fails after those
    writes would therefore block its own retry until someone deletes them by
    hand. The files to remove are exactly ``plan.state_writes``, which is why
    the list is passed in rather than reconstructed.

    The flag is True whenever this table is emitted at all: :func:`build_plan`
    populates ``plan.state_writes`` unconditionally and knows nothing about
    ``--dry-run`` (that flag is honoured in :func:`cmd_delegate_plan`, one
    layer up). So a dry-run plan carries a populated ``state_writes`` and a
    True flag for files that were never created -- deletion must therefore be
    best-effort on the consumer side (``missing_ok``), not an assertion that
    the paths exist. ``state_writes`` stays a parameter because it names WHICH

    ``transport`` selects the capacity model (design-review Blocker #1): the
    caller passes the value it already resolved from ``ORG_TRANSPORT`` / the
    transport descriptor -- it is never inferred from the ``panes`` snapshot.
    The Python default is ``"renga"`` so existing direct-API callers keep the
    rect-based behaviour unchanged; production callers (the CLI) resolve the
    env default (broker) and pass it explicitly.

    - ``transport="renga"``: unchanged rect-based :func:`choose_split`; no
      candidate -> ``split_capacity_exceeded`` with the geometry message.
    - ``transport="broker"``: :func:`choose_split` is bypassed. ``capacity_policy``
      (default :meth:`CapacityPolicy.default`, a finite ceiling of
      :data:`DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENT_WORKERS`) caps concurrent workers; the spawn
      addresses a stable adapter-resolvable target. ``live_worker_names``, when
      given, reconciles the active-worker count against registry liveness (see
      :func:`count_active_workers`).

    runtime #158 adds four keyword-only inputs, appended AFTER the existing
    keyword-only block so nothing shifts for a positional caller (ja's
    documented ``build_plan(task, panes, state_dir, locale=ja)`` is untouched):

    - ``peers``: a ``list_peers`` snapshot. This is the org-wide worker
      population under renga 2.0, where ``list_panes`` only sees the caller's
      tab. Omitted -> the population is derived from ``panes`` alone and every
      number is numerically identical to today.
    - ``server_capabilities``: the renga protocol tokens the CALLER asserts
      the server advertises. The MCP surface cannot be probed for them, so
      this is an assertion; omitting it makes every tab feature fail closed.
    - ``tab``: an externally-tagged renga TabSelector (see
      :func:`parse_tab_selector`). Requires ``spawn_tab``.
    - ``overflow_to_new_tab``: when the caller tab has no balanced-split
      candidate left, place the worker in a fresh background tab instead of
      escalating. Requires ``spawn_tab``. This is the ONLY mode in which the
      renga path consults ``capacity_policy``, because it is the only mode in
      which the rect ceiling no longer bounds the fleet.
