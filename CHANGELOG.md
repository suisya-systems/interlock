## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **S5 -- the spike SQLite schema slice** (D-0026 / D-0001 / D-0007, R3, Issue
  #12). `src/claude_org_runtime/control_plane/spike_schema.sql` is the six-table
  slice -- `run`, `session`, `lease`, `outbox`, `incident`, `action` -- that gate
  items 2, 4, 5 and 6 need, and nothing they do not exercise. It is **not** the
  full `Q-0001` DDL and does not aspire to be one.

  **The marking is in the schema file, at the top, where the acceptance
  criterion puts it**: this is a spike schema and **no migration path is
  promised from it**. `schema.py` is the enforcement arm of that sentence rather
  than a second copy of it -- a database at another `user_version` is *refused*,
  never migrated, and `load_schema_sql()` refuses DDL whose marking has been
  edited away. D-0026's failure mode is a spike schema becoming *the* schema by
  inertia, and inertia is exactly what a working migration path would supply.

  **What the schema deliberately does not encode.** `Q-0001` (per-item writer
  assignment) and `Q-0002` (incident collapse semantics) stay open: no column,
  CHECK or index anywhere names a component or a role, `incident.dedup_key` is
  indexed but **not** unique so the increment-in-place rule is not forced, and a
  nullable `related_incident_id` keeps the linked-incident rule expressible
  without meaning "collapsed into". No re-notification window, reconcile
  interval or time bucket appears in the file at all -- `Q-0003` has to settle
  tolerable detection latency first. The tests parameterise the collapse rule
  and run both branches, which is what `ACCEPTANCE.md` section 2 asks of every
  downstream test until it is decided.

  **`dedup_key` and `retry_count` are required and non-nullable on incidents**
  (D-0007), and `retry_count` is monotonic on both `incident` and `outbox` by
  trigger -- "restart-surviving, monotonically increasing" is a property a
  recovery query has to be able to show, not a convention a handler remembers.

  **State is reconstructable by query from SQLite alone** (D-0001).
  `RECONSTRUCTION_QUERIES` holds the five recovery reads as data so they can be
  run by hand against a database recovered from a crash, and `reconstruct()`
  keeps nothing in the process: the suite proves it by writing state, dropping
  the interpreter, and comparing what a **fresh subprocess** reads back. Item 2's
  "exactly one session per run" is a partial unique index rather than a
  check-then-insert, because a check-then-insert leaves precisely the window
  item 2 injects into; the lease epoch is a fencing token that cannot go
  backwards or be deleted away, and a protected write validates it inside the
  write.

  **Corrupt state is refused, not recovered as empty** (R3). An absent database,
  a file that is not SQLite, a truncated one, a missing state table, a foreign
  `application_id`, an unknown revision and a dangling foreign key are each a
  typed refusal. Verification runs over a **read-only** connection, so a refused
  database is left byte-identical -- no rollback journal, no recreated table, no
  silently empty start.

  Throwaway under D-0026, named explicitly by it, and it survives a C2 switch:
  nothing in it is provider-shaped.

- **S3 -- the stub `SessionProvider` over local child processes** (D-0020 /
  D-0026, Issue #11). `src/claude_org_runtime/session/stub_provider.py`
  implements every S1 verb with the standard library alone: a session is one
  ordinary child process, and there is **no Claude CLI and no network** in the
  loop. It is written *before* the real provider on purpose (D-0020): the
  control-plane suite takes its vocabulary from whichever provider exists while
  it is written, so with the stub first no `claude -p`-shaped assumption can
  enter it, and gate item 11 measures a structural property rather than a
  retrofit.

  **The degraded paths are first-class, because they are the ones item 11's
  re-run exercises.** An interpreter that cannot be executed fails the
  capability probe, and the fail-closed precondition then refuses the spawn
  with nothing created (D-0010). A child that is alive but has not yet written
  its state word yields an `Ok` carrying a **could-not-observe** readout with
  its reason -- not a `Failure` and not an empty one (R4) -- and the window is
  reachable through the child's own announce delay rather than by injecting a
  fault, so no test has to monkeypatch to reach it. Re-entering a session whose
  child has exited is refused with a reason instead of answered with a readout
  of something that is not running.

  **The readout carries the child's own state word**, read back from the file
  the child writes it to. A stub that derived a word from `poll()` would be
  putting its own vocabulary where the contract says the provider's belongs,
  and would answer in the stub a question the real provider answers
  differently. Gate item 7's workspace surface gets a real producer for the
  same reason: the stub announces the one transition it actually makes
  (creating a workspace it was asked to start in), and a veto leaves neither a
  directory nor a session behind -- an announced transition nothing acts on
  would give the suite a veto to test that has no effect.

  **Unusable input is answered, never raised.** `settings` is opaque and a
  session id is the caller's to choose, so the stub refuses -- with a reason --
  a session id that is not one safe file name (it names a state file after the
  id, and an id that escaped the state root would pick which file the provider
  deletes), a workspace or child command that is not a usable path or argument
  list, and a state root it cannot write. A child that writes bytes that are
  not UTF-8 is could-not-observe, not a decoding error out of `read_state()`.

  **Deliberately trivial** is a requirement of the issue, not a caveat: no
  retry, no reconnection, no cached probe, and no verb that writes to a child
  -- delivery is `MessageBus`'s (D-0009, S8), and a stub that grew a delivery
  path would make gate items 6 and 11 unmeasurable. Throwaway under D-0026, and
  it survives a C2 switch untouched.

- **S1 -- the provisional `SessionProvider` interface** (D-0009 / D-0010 /
  D-0021, R4, Issue #10). `src/claude_org_runtime/session/provider.py` renders
  the settled design into a contract file: D-0009's five verbs and no sixth, a
  provider-neutral lifecycle / availability readout carrying the backend's own
  state word uninterpreted plus an explicit **"could not observe"** case, a
  typed result that **cannot be constructed empty** in either direction (R4),
  and a capability / version probe wired to a **fail-closed spawn
  precondition** (D-0010) that refuses on an unprobed provider just as it
  refuses on an incompatible one -- and on a probe result that is not one of
  this interface's own result types, since a duck-typed stand-in whose
  `compatible` happens to be true would otherwise spawn.

  **The gate is the contract's, not each implementation's.** `start()` is
  concrete: it runs the precondition and then delegates to the abstract
  `_start_session()`, and a subclass that overrides `start()` or
  `require_spawnable()` is refused at class-definition time -- checked against
  the method the completed MRO resolves, since `class P(StartMixin,
  SessionProvider)` puts no `start` in `P.__dict__` while the mixin's is the
  one that runs. An implementation
  that forgot to call the check would have spawned against an unchecked
  provider while passing every happy-path test.

  **The file says of itself that it is provisional** (D-0021): it is spike
  scaffold, and promotion to a settled contract requires a later `D-` entry --
  not use by an implementation, and not having survived a gate run.

  **Both prohibitions are mechanically asserted, not trusted to review.** No
  fact-state vocabulary appears anywhere in S1, and the forbidden set is
  *parsed out of `DECISIONS.md`* rather than copied into the test, so a seventh
  state added by a future `D-` entry is covered the day it is written. No
  delivery verb appears either: delivery stays with `MessageBus` (S8) per
  D-0009, and what S1 records is the **absence**, which is the property gate
  items 6 and 11 exist to check.

  **The three previously-unassigned capabilities each have a named owner**, and
  owning one is not the same as putting it in S1: message delivery ->
  `MessageBus`/S8 (absent here by design); effective permission / sandbox /
  hook readback -> **neither contract**, written down as unowned because no
  public surface returns it and D-0010 forbids manufacturing one, with S10's
  partial readback plus breach battery recorded as the human-accepted
  weakening; observing or vetoing a workspace lifecycle transition -> S1, as a
  veto surface rather than a sixth verb, fail-closed so that a broken observer
  vetoes instead of letting a transition through.

  Unblocks gate item 11, which had nothing to substitute against while this
  file did not exist.

- **Per-role fencing: the renderer, the fail-closed spawn precondition, the
  `PreToolUse` deny hook and the breach-probe battery** (gate item 3, I-04/S10,
  Issue #9). `src/claude_org_runtime/fencing/` carries the per-role
  permission / sandbox / hooks renderer from `settings/generator.py`, **minus
  the transport and `sandbox_by_pattern` axes the porting ledger discards** —
  and refuses to render a role document that still carries either, because
  dropping a discarded axis silently produces a fence narrower than its author
  believed.

  **The battery's unit is the rule, not the role.** D-0023 asks for one
  forbidden operation per *rule*, and the battery is therefore derived from the
  rendered fence rather than authored: 44 rules across four roles, one probe
  each, coverage asserted as a set equality and re-asserted by adding a rule at
  runtime and requiring the battery to grow with it. A hand-maintained probe
  list passes the first check and fails the second. Per-role probing would have
  observed 4 of 44.

  **Fail-closed is Interlock's own obligation** (D-0023 part 2 under D-0017).
  All three broken configurations Issue #9 names refuse the spawn — config
  deleted, hook path unresolvable, sandbox profile absent — as does a fence
  that renders cleanly but does not deny its own probes. The load-bearing
  assertion is negative: **the spawner callable is never invoked**, and nothing
  is published, so a refused spawn cannot leave a fence behind for the next
  start to enforce as though approved. Refusals are `fsync`ed to an append-only
  ledger before the caller is told anything.

  **The deny hook is proven to deny, not merely to run.**
  `investigation/i04-pretooluse-fence-probe.md` measured nine `claude -p`
  children by effect, never by exit code: a JSON `deny` at exit 2 stops the
  operation, and **a hook exiting 1 is absorbed while the operation goes
  through** — A6/U35's shape, reproduced on `PreToolUse`. All nine cases exited
  0. **U15 is answered**: `PreToolUse` fires and denies under
  `bypassPermissions`, and the renderer refuses that mode anyway, because it
  leaves the hook as the only layer. **U42 is new**: an unresolvable hook fails
  open or closed purely on the launcher's exit code (`python3` 2 blocks, `bash`
  127 does not), which is why hook paths are validated before the spawn rather
  than trusted to fail closed. **U43 is open**: timeouts were not probed.

  **Item 3 is recorded as `discharged` on C2 in `docs/gate-record.md`, on the
  weakened observable D-0023 defines** — the residual is stated in D-0023's own
  terms and not folded into the verdict: no public surface returns effective
  hooks or sandbox configuration (U3, i01 §3.9), so the battery observes
  behaviour against the fence *Interlock rendered* and the diff proves **what
  we wrote, not what the provider loaded**. A deliberate weakening accepted by
  a human, not an equivalent method. Per D-0026 `tests/fencing/` (86 tests) is
  the durable output and the implementation is throwaway.

- **Gate record for the eleven Agent View gate items** (I-19, Issue #24).
  `docs/gate-record.md` is the single place where each item carries a verdict,
  its evidence, the provider that evidence was obtained against, and the D-0022
  label -- "proven on the spike slice" or "re-proven on the real
  implementation". Without one document holding that labelling, the scoped
  exception D-0022 grants (items 8 and 10 deferred, **not waived**) degrades
  into an unaccountable claim that the gate passed.

  Two rows are settled. **Item 2 is recorded as failed on C1 (Agent View)** per
  D-0027 -- U1 negative and the D-0024 fence search empty -- with its C2
  re-proof pending in #18, so the provider history is on the record rather than
  reconstructable only from git; its residual is stated as the absence of a
  backstop (U27's admission window, U32's unfenced `--resume`), and an
  interleaved transcript is explicitly *not* an accepted residual. **Item 9 is
  recorded as discharged in full and independently of the spike** (#22,
  PR #27), uniquely untouched by the provider switch. The other nine rows are
  pending with their evidence sources named, because the record is most needed
  on the branches where that evidence never arrives.

  `tests/gate_record/` enforces the structural half: eleven items present and
  distinct, closed verdict/label/provider vocabularies, the summary table and
  the per-item sections agreeing, items 8 and 10 not marked discharged before
  their named discharge points, and item 2's C1 failure not deleted by a later
  edit. Per D-0026 the tests are durable; the record itself is a contract
  artifact, and no artifact it classifies is promoted by being listed there.

- **Curator promotion gate with a content-digest approval record** (gate item 9,
  Issue #22). Curator output cannot reach skill material without a human
  approval that names an immutable candidate version by content digest
  (D-0018).

  The gate sits at the **filesystem write**, not at a promotion function,
  because U8 is answered affirmative: an already-running Claude Code session
  re-reads skill material from disk, so writing the file already *is*
  promotion. U8 was settled by documentation search and by a direct runtime
  probe on CLI 2.1.234 -- an edited body, an edited description and a skill
  directory created mid-session were all live in one running session, and a
  mid-session directory turned out to be loadable *before* it appeared in the
  session's own skill listing. Transcript:
  `investigation/u8-skill-hot-reload-probe.md`.

  `PromotionGate` is the only code that writes into skill material and the only
  code that may name a skill root. Promotion is refused, and the refusal
  recorded in the approval ledger, when the approval is absent, forged but
  unrecorded, edited after being recorded, revoked, when the candidate was
  mutated after approval, and when a valid approval is replayed against another
  candidate or another target. `claude_org_runtime.curator.audit` is a path
  audit over the source tree, run as a test, so adding a bypass path later
  fails the build; synthetic positive controls prove the audit is not vacuous.

  Per D-0026 the tests are the durable output; the implementation is throwaway
  by default. Design note: `docs/curator-promotion-gate.md`.

## [0.1.42] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- An explicit **adopt / handover path for delivery ownership**: `org adopt`
  plus the `adopt_delivery` / `adopt_status` admin RPCs (Issue #166).

  Until now the only way an owner's delivery ownership moved was as a side
  effect — a rotate on the next spawn, or a pane being closed. A session that
  lost it could not get it back, and a session started by hand had no way to
  claim it. Adopt makes the takeover a first-class operation:

  ```
  claude-org-runtime org adopt --owner worker-a --resume <session-id>
  claude-org-runtime org adopt --owner worker-a --status   # query only
  ```

  **Adopt is a launcher, not a message to a running session.** The observer
  secret is a non-replayable signal precisely because it rides in process env,
  which fork/resume does not inherit — and a running process's env cannot be
  rewritten from outside. Adding a dynamic handoff channel to the sidecar would
  have let a forked sidecar call it too, dissolving the asymmetry the lease is
  built on. So `org adopt` rotates the lease and starts a *new* claude process
  holding the new secret, with `--resume` / `--continue` carrying the
  conversation.

  **The handover boundary is the fence, not the RPC.** Rotating the lease alone
  does not stop the incumbent: the old `(generation, instance_id)` stays current
  and `poll_claims` never re-checks the secret. `adopt_delivery` therefore bumps
  the generation *and* clears the registered instance in one lock scope, which
  fences every caller until the adopting sidecar registers. In that window
  nobody delivers and no rows are lost.

  **Issuing the secret is not treated as success.** Each adopt carries an
  adoption id and a finite arming deadline. If no adopting sidecar registers in
  time the daemon restores the previous generation and instance
  (compare-and-restore) and journals `delivery_adopt_expired` — without that
  restore a failed adopt would mute the owner permanently, because a fenced
  sidecar never re-registers. A concurrent adopt is rejected with
  `[adopt_in_flight]` rather than silently winning; `--force` makes superseding
  an explicit choice and journals it.

  **In-flight rows are the operator's call**, not the daemon's:
  `--in-flight requeue|drop`. `requeue` (default) matches the existing
  at-least-once posture and may show the adopting agent a message the previous
  host already emitted; `drop` marks those rows delivered and accepts losing the
  tail instead. The count and the chosen policy are recorded in both the RPC
  response and the journal.

  Authorization is **admin-token only**. Adopt can fence a live incumbent
  unconditionally, so it is exposed neither on the MCP tool surface nor to a
  delivery credential; the owner's existence and its delivery credential are
  verified in the same lock scope as the rotate.

  The owner's bind is **re-keyed** rather than reused or re-minted: the adopting
  session gets a fresh bearer token for the same bind, and the token the previous
  process holds stops resolving. Re-minting would leave two binds for one
  `agent_id` and make delivery resolution ambiguous; reusing the token would
  leave two live processes sharing one `session_id`, where each `initialize`
  evicts the other's session. Because it is the same bind object, `registered`
  and `cwd` carry across, so messages sent mid-handover still queue instead of
  bouncing. Expiry rolls the re-key back along with the fence.

  Closing the previous pane no longer collapses the handover: adopt marks that
  pane detached, so its close/reap skips the credential and queue cleanup that
  would otherwise revoke the adopted session's access. Expiry restores the
  marking, and if the pane was already closed the expiry reports
  `restored: false` rather than claiming it handed delivery back to a sidecar
  that no longer exists.

- The attention watcher gained operator-facing consumers for two more broker
  journal signals: `delivery_register_superseded` (a session was superseded and
  has stopped claiming for good) and `delivery_adopt_expired` (Issue #166). Both
  default to `urgent` in `DEFAULT_NOTIFY` and both are one-shot, so they get
  their own, much longer freshness window (`delivery_signal_window_sec`,
  default 3600s) than the repeating `duplicate_sidecar_detected`. Previously the
  only consumed journal line was `duplicate_sidecar_detected`, so a session
  going mute reached nobody.

- `Broker(adopt_arming_seconds=...)` tunable (default 300s).

### Changed

- **Potentially breaking**: `--resume` is now a *reserved* flag in the
  interactive claude argv builder. It is newly accepted (it was previously
  rejected as an unknown flag) but only through the structured
  `build_claude_argv(resume=...)` field — passing it in free-form `args[]`
  (`spawn_claude_pane`) or `--claude-arg` (`org up` / `org adopt`) raises
  `ToolArgError`. Routing the session selector through one structured field is
  what lets the builder enforce mutual exclusion with `--continue`; a free-form
  hole would have allowed a second, conflicting selector to be appended after
  the adopt's own.

  `--continue` is deliberately **not** reserved, so existing callers that pass
  it through `args[]` keep working; it is only rejected in combination with
  `resume=`, and a duplicate is folded when both the structured field and
  `args[]` supply it.

- `docs/channel-delivery-model-decision.md` §6.5.3 / §7 / §8 refreshed against
  the shipped code. Those sections still described `observer_pending` as a
  permanent latch and `_stood_down` as unrecoverable, both of which stopped
  being true in #171 — a stale rationale in that note is read as the basis for
  the next change, so it is now maintained as living status.

### Removed

- The three `Write(...)` entries in the bundled `role_configs_schema.json`'s
  `roles.secretary.required_deny` (Issue #178):

  ```
  Write(*/workers/*/.claude/settings.local.json)
  Write(*/workers/*/.worktrees/*/.claude/settings.local.json)
  Write(*/.worktrees/*/.claude/settings.local.json)
  ```

  Claude Code's file permission check evaluates `Edit(path)` rules only, so a
  `Write(path)` deny never matched and the session printed a warning per rule at
  startup:

  ```
  Permission deny rule: Write(*/workers/*/.claude/settings.local.json) is not
  matched by file permission checks -- only Edit(path) rules are.
  Use Edit(*/workers/*/.claude/settings.local.json) instead
  ```

  **This is not a weakening of the deny surface.** The matching `Edit(...)` rule
  for each of the three globs stays, and those are the rules that were doing the
  enforcing all along. What is removed is inert text whose only observable
  effect was a warning that operators read as "the settings-file guard is dead".

  The three globs are byte-identical to the ones dropped on the ja side, which
  is the requirement `tools/check_runtime_schema_drift.py` enforces:
  `required_deny` is inside the byte-compared surface (only `$comment*` keys are
  stripped before comparison), so this release and the paired ja change have to
  land together — either half alone reports DRIFT. Consumers pinning this
  version must take the ja-side removal in the same step.

## [0.1.41] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- `server_info`, renga 2.0.0's capability probe, is now part of the renga
  transport surface: `transport.descriptor.RENGA_REQUIRED_TOOLS` grows from
  14 to 15 entries, and the bundled `role_configs_schema.json` gains
  `mcp__renga-peers__server_info` in `user_common` (14 -> 15 renga entries)
  and `secretary` (12 -> 13) (Issue #161).

  This closes a gap against the ja-side source of truth: `check_renga_compat`'s
  `REQUIRED_MCP_TOOLS` has listed `server_info` since renga 2.0.0, so a
  compat check could pass while the surface the runtime projects still
  withheld the tool. `server_info` reports the running server's advertised
  capability tokens without making a capability-gated request, which is what
  lets a caller pre-flight a token (`spawn_tab`, say) instead of reading a
  `[server_too_old]` error out of a failed call.

  The entry is appended **last** in both the descriptor tuple and the schema
  column. Order is the bit-equivalence anchor between the descriptor and ja's
  `user_common` `required_allow`, so appending keeps the existing 14 entries
  byte-identical for consumers that regenerate settings from the descriptor;
  a mid-column insert would not. A test pins the position.

  `worker`, `curator` and `dispatcher` deliberately do **not** declare
  `server_info` in their own `required_allow`: worker and curator inherit the
  shared `user_common` surface, and dispatcher runs under
  `bypassPermissions`, where `permissions.allow` is a no-op. Per-role
  expectations (`user_common` = 15, `secretary` = 13 including `server_info`,
  the other three absent) are now asserted explicitly rather than left to
  subset relations.

  Not changed: `dispatcher delegate-plan --server-capability` remains a
  caller-supplied assertion. The planner is offline -- it reads `list_panes` /
  `list_peers` snapshots from disk and never calls MCP -- so it cannot probe
  regardless of the tool being allowlisted. Whether a probe result should
  replace that assertion is a separate question.

## [0.1.40] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- `attention scan` / `attention watch` now consume the org-broker journal
  and raise a `duplicate_sidecar` notification when two channel sidecars
  are claiming the same owner's queue (Issue #167). Detection has been in
  the daemon since Issue #125 -- `poll_claims` records every polling
  instance *before* the fencing decision, so even a stale generation
  leaves evidence -- but nothing in the repo read the resulting
  `duplicate_sidecar_detected` line. An operator learned about a double
  sidecar by noticing that reports had stopped arriving, which is exactly
  the failure mode the signal was added to make visible.

  The watcher reads only the **tail** of `.state/broker/queue.jsonl` (the
  journal is append-only and never rotated), walking backwards until it
  passes `duplicate_sidecar_window_sec` (default 300s) so the bytes read
  follow the configured window rather than a fixed cap -- a busy daemon
  cannot push a still-live incident out of view. That window is what makes
  the alert mean "this is happening now": the store re-emits per instance
  pair once per lease window for as long as both sidecars keep polling, so
  a live incident keeps re-firing while a resolved one falls silent by
  itself. The daemon-side per-pair cooldown is untouched, and the
  notification is dedup'd on the contesting `(owner, instance-pair)` — a
  *new* competitor after the operator kills one session counts as a new
  incident rather than being swallowed by the previous pair's cooldown.

  Defaults: severity `urgent` (nothing in the runtime resolves a double
  claimer -- only a human can find and end the extra session), title
  `Duplicate channel sidecar`, body naming the owner and both instance
  ids. `--broker-state-dir` overrides the default `<state-dir>/broker`
  location for a daemon started with a non-default `--state-dir`.

### Fixed

- Channel delivery: the observer lease now covers the `spawn_claude` path, and a
  sidecar's stand-down is no longer an unrecoverable latch (Issues #165 + #169).
  These ship together on purpose - see below.

  Before this change the observer lease, the only signal a forked session cannot
  replay, was asserted for exactly one owner (`org up`'s secretary).
  `spawn_claude` handed out a delivery credential and wired a channel sidecar but
  never asserted a lease, so every dispatcher and worker pane fell through to
  last-register-wins. A forked or resumed session's registration therefore
  **deterministically fenced the original**, which then polled forever and emitted
  nothing while messages were delivered into a session nobody was watching. The
  journal read `claimed` + `delivered`; the operator saw silence. That was the
  default for every spawned pane, not a rare race
  (`docs/channel-delivery-model-decision.md` §4.1).

  `spawn_claude` now asserts the lease and hands the secret to the child through
  the **pane process environment**, never through `--mcp-config`: the mcp-config is
  precisely what a fork replays verbatim, which is the whole reason the secret has
  to travel out of band. Owners with no asserted lease are untouched and keep
  last-register-wins, so callers without an env handoff do not lose push.

  Extending the lease to every owner also multiplies the number of sessions that
  can be refused at registration, and the sidecar's `_stood_down` latch had no
  clear path - a legitimate hand-started session would have been muted permanently.
  Registration refusals are therefore now split by **what the daemon can actually
  know**, namely whether the caller presented a secret at all:

  - presented a secret that does not match the active lease -> the caller once held
    one and was rotated out, so it is superseded. Still `unobserved`, still latches.
    Retrying cannot make a superseded instance legitimate, which is the reason the
    latch exists.
  - presented no secret -> a fork replay and an operator's hand-started session are
    indistinguishable here, and guessing between them is the job of the explicit
    adopt path (#166), not of this code. New non-latching `observer_pending`: the
    push loop retries at poll cadence instead of going silent for good.

  A refused registration does not bump the generation and does not move in-flight
  rows, so retrying cannot ping-pong the generation with the live session.

  For that retry to be safe rather than merely delayed, an activated lease is now
  **sticky**: a lapsed TTL marks the lease `stale` and keeps fencing instead of
  falling back to last-register-wins. A stopped heartbeat is not evidence of death
  - Ctrl+Z on the pane sends SIGTSTP to the whole process group, and a laptop
  suspend, a slow MCP restart or an NTP clock step all produce the same gap - while
  the incumbent registers exactly once per lifetime and a fork retries every
  second. A TTL-expiry door is therefore a door only a fork can walk through. What
  opens it instead is an external act: the pane closing or being reaped (a death
  the broker actually observed), a respawn rotating the lease, or the explicit
  adopt path when #166 lands. An incumbent that comes back and resumes polling
  simply moves its lease back to `active`.

  Because `reset_delivery_state` (pane close/reap) is now a load-bearing release
  path rather than a tidy-up, it can no longer rely on being reached
  opportunistically. The reaper only runs from registry entry points such as
  spawn, close or send_keys, and `/claim-owner` reaches none of them, so a pane
  that died outside the broker's view would have kept its lease fenced for as long
  as no unrelated call happened to run. A registration refused on account of a
  *stale* lease now triggers one rate-limited liveness probe, so a dead pane is
  reaped promptly and its lease does not outlive it. This is not the TTL door
  returning: the evidence is the adapter's answer about whether the pane exists,
  not elapsed time, and a merely suspended pane still holds its lease.

  Leases asserted on the spawn path carry an **activation deadline** (10 minutes by
  default, `observer_arming_seconds`), because the secret's journey to the child
  crosses backend-specific machinery - tmux `-e`, a wezterm argv rewrite, a herdr
  `pane.split` and shell inheritance - and the last leg, whether Claude Code passes
  its environment to a stdio MCP server, is outside this repository. Where that
  handoff fails, the pane's own sidecar cannot present the secret, and an
  never-expiring armed lease would mute that owner permanently. If no observed
  registration ever arrives, the lease is dropped, `observer_arming_expired` is
  journalled, and the owner returns to today's behaviour - safe precisely because
  "nobody ever presented the secret" is the definition of "there is no incumbent to
  protect". The launcher/secretary path keeps its unbounded arming window, since a
  human may sit on the stage-1 folder-trust prompt. Relatedly, only a registration
  bearing the secret can activate an armed lease; a poll no longer can, which also
  closes the gap noted in the decision note's §7 item 5.

  Stood-down state is also observable from outside the sidecar process now:
  `delivery_dump` reports, per owner and per instance, which sidecar is not
  claiming, why, since when, and whether that state is permanent. Sidecars fenced
  at poll time (`stale_sidecar`) are included - they are the common case, and
  recording only registration refusals would have missed them.

  The observer secret is redacted from tool-call error messages and from the
  journal. Adapters put their whole argument vector into failure messages, which
  reach both the calling agent and `queue.jsonl` (a file that, unlike
  `admin.token`, is not 0600).

## [0.1.39] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- `dispatcher delegate-plan`: the concurrent-worker count no longer
  under-reports the fleet under renga 2.0, where it silently over-spawned
  (Issue #158). renga 2.0 scopes `list_panes` to the **caller's own tab**,
  so a dispatcher in tab 0 counting worker panes simply cannot see the
  workers running in tabs 1..N. Every capacity number derived from that
  snapshot was therefore a per-tab number being used as an org-wide one:
  a ceiling of 8 would admit a 9th, 10th and 11th worker as long as the
  extras lived in other tabs.

  The fix separates the two jobs the pane snapshot was doing. `--panes-json`
  stays the **geometry** source -- it is the only input carrying rects, and
  the balanced split still ranks exactly those rects -- while a new
  `--peers-json` (`list_peers`) becomes the **population** source, because
  peers span every tab. The count is the union of worker panes and worker
  peers, deduped on pane `name`.

  Union rather than replacement, and `name` rather than the pane id, are
  both load-bearing. A freshly spawned worker exists as a pane for the
  10-30s before its peer bind registers -- the helper's own `after_spawn`
  step waits up to ~30s for exactly that -- so a second `delegate-plan`
  inside that window would under-count and over-spawn again if peers simply
  replaced panes. And `name` is the only key present on both surfaces of
  every transport: the broker's `list_peers` reports `id = agent_id`
  (`worker-foo`) while its `list_panes` reports `id = adapter handle`
  (`%3`), so a pane-id dedup would double-count every broker worker instead.

  No capability negotiation is involved, deliberately. renga 1.4's
  `list_peers` is already caller-tab-only and renga 2.0's spans tabs, so
  counting worker peers yields the correct number on both without knowing
  which server is on the wire -- which is what lets the correctness fix land
  here without waiting for a paired consumer release. Omitting
  `--peers-json` reproduces the previous numbers exactly.

- `settings`: deny paths that cross an **absolute symlink** are now
  rewritten to their realpath instead of being handed to bubblewrap
  as-is. On WSL2, where `~/.aws` is commonly a symlink into `/mnt/c`,
  such a path made bwrap abort at launch with
  `bwrap: Can't create file at /home/<user>/.aws/config: No such file or
  directory`. That failure is not fail-closed: Claude Code's escape hatch
  then retries with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox`, so **every subsequent
  Bash command ran unsandboxed with no standing signal** — a worker could
  believe it was isolated for months while it was not.

  The trigger was specifically the **Layer 2** mirror. Claude Code merges
  `permissions.deny` `Read(...)` / `Edit(...)` rules into the same deny
  set as `sandbox.filesystem.deny{Read,Write}`, so the `Read(~/.aws/*)`
  mirror that existed as the *compensating control* for the already
  suppressed Layer 3 entry is what re-injected the unbindable path. The
  renderer now canonicalizes both layers. Rewriting rather than dropping
  keeps the deny intact, and the Layer 2 tool-level block still applies
  through the original symlinked path because Claude Code resolves
  symlinks when matching `Read` / `Edit` rules.

  Only absolute symlinks are rewritten: relative symlinks resolve
  correctly inside bwrap's staging newroot, and unanchored globs such as
  `Read(**/credentials*)` are never expanded into host paths. Both
  boundaries were established empirically against bubblewrap 0.6.1 and a
  live client, not inferred.

### Added

- `dispatcher delegate-plan`: tab-directed spawning under renga 2.0, via
  `--tab SELECTOR` (`pane_id:N` / `index:N` / `name:LABEL` / `new` /
  `new:LABEL`) and `--overflow-to-new-tab`, both gated on an explicit
  `--server-capability spawn_tab` assertion (Issue #158).

  The gate is an assertion rather than a probe because renga's MCP surface
  does not expose the server's capability list at all -- it enforces
  capabilities internally and only ever surfaces an `[server_too_old] ...`
  error string. Omission therefore fails closed: a caller that passes
  nothing new can never have a `tab` key emitted into its plan, and so can
  never be handed a request an older renga would refuse. The three renga
  tokens stay distinct for the same reason renga made them distinct -- a
  renga#288-era server advertises `caller_scope` while still silently
  dropping cross-tab sends, so `caller_scope` never authorises cross-tab
  reasoning and `cross_tab_peers` never authorises a `tab` key.

  An **index** selector the peer census resolves is canonicalised to
  `{"pane_id": N}`, because renga documents the tab index as display
  metadata that renumbers when a tab closes -- a plan carrying an index can
  address the wrong tab if anything closes between emission and the spawn
  call. A **name** never is, and neither is refused locally. The census is a
  lower bound on the tab table, not an inventory: a tab whose panes are all
  non-peer is invisible to `list_peers`. So "the census sees one tab with
  this name" is not evidence the name is unique, and canonicalising on that
  basis would bypass exactly the rule renga's `tab_ambiguous` exists to
  enforce -- with a visible tab and a peerless tab sharing a display name,
  the census sees one match and would silently spawn into whichever one it
  could see, turning a request renga would have refused into a wrong-tab
  placement. For the same reason a selector the census cannot resolve is
  emitted rather than rejected: renga is the authority, it does the exact
  match and the range check, and it owns `tab_not_found` / `tab_ambiguous`.
  The census still annotates the plan with what it *can* see, including a
  warning that renga is about to answer `tab_ambiguous`, so the operator is
  not surprised. A tab spawn into an existing tab uses `target: "focused"`, which
  renga resolves *inside* the selected tab; that is also what structurally
  prevents `target_tab_mismatch`, since the runtime never pairs a
  caller-tab numeric target with a foreign-tab selector. A `tab: {new}`
  spawn omits `target` and `direction` as **absent keys** rather than
  nulls, because renga forbids them at the schema level for that variant
  and a JSON `null` counts as present.

  `--overflow-to-new-tab` is opt-in, and it re-enables
  `--max-concurrent-workers` on the renga path. Under renga the only worker
  ceiling has ever been "the balanced split found no candidate", and
  overflow deletes exactly that. It also does not self-limit: because
  `list_panes` is caller-tab-scoped, the next `delegate-plan` re-observes
  the same saturated tab and would mint yet another tab, so N delegations
  produce N tabs. The explicit fleet ceiling is the only bound left, which
  is why that one mode consults it. Outside overflow the renga path still
  ignores the policy entirely.

  That ceiling counts outstanding **reservations** as well as the observed
  census, because the pane/peer union cannot cover an overflow spawn. A
  same-tab spawn is safe across the peer-bind delay -- its pane appears in
  the caller's `list_panes` immediately -- but an overflowed one lands in a
  tab of its own, which caller-tab scoping keeps out of `list_panes`
  permanently, and it is not a peer for another 10-30s. For that window it
  is invisible to both inputs, so back-to-back delegations each re-observe
  the same census and each admit another worker: measured, a ceiling of 2
  admitted three workers with every plan reporting `free_worker_slots: 2`.
  The ledger is the worker seed file the helper already writes, credited
  only while it is younger than the 45s bind window and its worker is still
  absent from the census -- so a worker that binds is never counted twice
  and a spawn that never came up frees its slot with no cleanup step.
  `plan.capacity` reports `reserved_workers` / `reserved_worker_names`
  beside the unchanged `active_workers`, and the escalation names the
  workers holding the slots (otherwise "0 active, 0 free" reads as a bug).
- `dispatcher delegate-plan`: three additive plan fields -- `population`
  (auditable worker census with provenance and a per-tab breakdown),
  `layout` (renga layout diagnostics), and `on_spawn_error` (a recovery
  table keyed by renga error code). All three are `null` on every
  invocation that predates Issue #158, with one deliberate exception:
  `layout` is populated on the renga `split_capacity_exceeded` path,
  because that escalation is exactly where an operator needs the numbers.

  `layout` folds the org sidebar into the capacity story by **measuring**
  it, never by subtracting it. renga carves the sidebar, the file tree and
  a swapped preview off the frame *before* the pane layout runs, and the
  rects it puts on the wire are the post-carve remainder -- so subtracting
  a sidebar width here would be a straight double subtraction, and would
  desync this module's prediction from renga's own split guard, which
  judges the very same rects. It would manufacture `split_capacity_exceeded`
  on layouts renga would happily split. Instead the pane area is recovered
  exactly as the bounding box of the pane rects (renga tiles them with no
  gaps and no overlap), and the reclaimable column count is that box's own
  `x` offset. That number is automatically right in every sidebar mode --
  default, compact, off -- with no terminal width, which the runtime never
  receives. The accompanying `reclaim_hint` names the likely decomposition
  (sidebar 26/16 plus file tree ~20) and explicitly labels it a candidate
  attribution, because `min(x)` is one equation in three unknowns.

  `on_spawn_error` exists because a tab spawn can fail *after* the helper
  has already written the worker seed and instruction files, and the helper
  refuses any task whose state files exist -- so a failed tab spawn would
  otherwise block its own retry. Each entry says what the code means, what
  to do, and carries `remove_state_writes` naming that concrete lockout.
  `pane_not_found` is in the table alongside the tab codes because the
  runtime deliberately addresses existing tabs by their anchor pane id: when
  that anchor closes (a worker finishing is the common case) renga answers
  `pane_not_found`, not `tab_not_found`, and without an entry the dispatcher
  would have no recovery -- and no `remove_state_writes` -- for the most
  likely failure of the strategy the runtime chose.

  Exit codes stay `0` / `1` / `2`. The tab error codes are plan-level
  only: they appear as the leading token of an error / escalation message
  and as `on_spawn_error` keys, never as a process exit status.

### Changed

- `dispatcher delegate-plan`: the renga `split_capacity_exceeded`
  **escalation message text** now carries an appended diagnostics paragraph,
  on a path that needs none of the new flags. This is the one user-visible
  behaviour delta for a caller that passes nothing new, and it matters
  because claude-org-ja forwards that string to the secretary verbatim: in
  this repo's own fixture it grows from 239 to 766 characters. The original
  sentence is preserved **byte for byte as a literal prefix** -- so
  `"MIN_PANE" in message` and `"max_concurrent_workers" not in message`
  still discriminate the rect reason from the fleet reason -- and everything
  appended is measured (pane area, left-panel columns, the advisory new-tab
  estimate, tabs seen) plus a one-sentence pointer at
  `--overflow-to-new-tab`. `plan.layout` carries the same facts structurally
  for consumers that would rather parse than read. Re-review any consumer
  that pattern-matches on the full escalation string or renders it into a
  fixed-width surface.
- `sandbox doctor`: preflight a rendered `settings.local.json` and exit
  non-zero when the sandbox would not actually start, so the silent
  fallback above becomes a checkable failure. Runs a static pass over
  every deny path both layers contribute (reporting the realpath rewrite
  that would fix each) plus a live `bwrap` canary that launches the
  sandbox with those paths bound. `--json`, `--verbose`, and
  `--no-probe-bwrap` are available; exit `0` usable / `1` broken / `2`
  missing or malformed settings. Settings that explicitly disable the
  sandbox pass the gate while still listing findings as latent, since
  deny arrays merge across settings scopes.

  Because Claude Code unions the deny arrays across scopes, the check
  merges the sibling project scope (`.claude/settings.json` next to a
  `settings.local.json`, or vice versa), the user
  (`~/.claude/settings.json`) and managed settings alongside the given
  file by default, and each finding names the file
  that contributed it. Auditing the rendered worker file alone would
  report a clean preflight while a symlinked path in another scope aborts
  the launch. `--settings` is repeatable and `--no-merge-scopes` restores
  single-file behavior.

  `sandbox.failIfUnavailable` is deliberately left alone: per the official
  docs it covers a missing dependency at startup, not a per-command bwrap
  launch failure. The knob for the silent fallback is
  `allowUnsandboxedCommands: false`, which this runtime also does not set
  — `docker` is incompatible with the sandbox and two worker roles allow
  `docker build` with no `excludedCommands` shipped, so forcing strict
  mode would break those workers outright. That trade-off is an operator
  decision; `sandbox doctor` makes the loss of isolation visible without
  changing what happens when a command cannot be sandboxed.
- `settings show --explain` now reports a `rewrites` list alongside
  `suppressions`, and the emitted `$comment` gains a
  `; symlink-canonicalized deny paths: [...]` clause. The contract-fixed
  `platform=<linux|wsl>, layer-3 entries suppressed: [` prefix that the
  ja-side launcher parses is unchanged.

## [0.1.38] - 2026-07-22

### Compatibility

- **Using herdr 0.7.5 or newer as the broker backend requires
  claude-org-runtime 0.1.38 or newer.** herdr 0.7.5 (wire protocol 17)
  rewrote the `agent.start` API in a breaking way; releases before 0.1.38
  only speak the protocol 14 / 16 shape and fail to spawn against it.
  Conversely 0.1.38 keeps the legacy path intact, so herdr 0.7.1-0.7.4
  (protocol 14 / 16) continue to work unchanged. The `herdr` backend
  remains opt-in and POSIX / WSL-only.

### Fixed

- `herdr` terminal backend: follow the herdr 0.7.5 `agent.start` API
  (runtime Issue #151, PR #152). 0.7.5 replaced the params with
  `{name, kind, pane_id, args, timeout_ms}` and stopped creating panes, so
  the adapter now provisions an agent pane via `pane.split` (carrying
  `cwd` / `env`), exports the venv `PATH` into it, and then starts the
  agent against that `pane_id`. The agent kind is passed explicitly from
  the broker rather than guessed from `argv[0]`, the agent pane is kept
  separate from the root pane (and guarded against root cleanup), and the
  transient `agent_pane_busy` race is retried with bounded backoff. The
  pre-0.7.5 path is preserved verbatim and selected by protocol.
- `herdr` terminal backend: probe the wire protocol at construction time
  and fail fast with `herdr_protocol_unsupported` on a permanent mismatch,
  before any on-disk side effects (generation bump / startup sweep) can
  run. An unreachable socket or an unreadable `pong` is treated as
  undetermined rather than unsupported, so a daemon blip no longer makes
  `broker serve` unstartable; the probe is retried when a spawn actually
  needs the answer. herdr 0.7.5 raw error codes are mapped instead of
  being rounded to `internal`.
- broker MCP surface: unexpected exceptions in `tools/call` are now
  returned as JSON-RPC errors (`-32603`) instead of escaping `do_POST` and
  leaving the handler thread to close the socket without a response —
  previously the only client-visible symptom was "The socket connection
  was closed unexpectedly" (runtime Issue #151). The diagnostic line
  carries the tool name and exception type / message but never the
  arguments; the traceback goes only to the daemon-local journal.
- `herdr` v075 spawn: reclaim the provisioned pane when a spawn fails
  after `pane.split`. Orphaned panes were invisible to the adapter but
  real to herdr, so the workspace sweep misread them as foreign and the
  workspace stayed permanently pending, which kept `org down` from
  closing out.

## [0.1.37] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- worker role templates: a deliberately narrow Docker build allow set is added
  to both `worker_roles.default` and `worker_roles.claude-org-self-edit`
  `permissions.allow` — `Bash(docker build:*)`, `Bash(docker buildx build:*)`,
  `Bash(docker images:*)`, `Bash(docker image inspect:*)`. Workers building org
  Docker images were being blocked by the auto-mode classifier on every docker
  command pattern (runtime Issue #147, refs suisya-systems/claude-org-ja#723).
  The set is intentionally narrow (Codex-reviewed, 2 rounds): it excludes
  `docker inspect:*` (reaches containers/networks/secrets via `--type`),
  `docker buildx:*` at large (registry-write `imagetools`, prune/rm), and
  run/compose/push/login/rmi/prune, all of which stay on per-command human
  approval. The read-only `doc-audit` template and `roles.worker.required_allow`
  (the byte-frozen ja `permissions.md` renga anchor) are intentionally
  untouched. A worker-role `~/.docker` denyRead was evaluated as a release gate
  and deferred: `~/.docker` also holds `config.json` (registry credentials) and
  the `contexts` symlink that legitimate builds pulling a private base image
  need, so a blanket denyRead risks breaking legitimate builds — tracked as a
  follow-up.

## [0.1.36] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- `broker`: push channel delivery is now bound to the **observed live session**,
  so a config-replay fork/resume or a background-hosted session can no longer
  hijack or silently destroy an owner's messages (runtime Issue #129, building
  on the #125 session fencing). Two failure modes are closed: (A) a
  forked/resumed session replays the persisted `--mcp-config` (delivery cred
  included), re-registers, and under last-register-wins bumps the owner's
  delivery generation to fence the real observed session out of claiming; and
  (B) a background-hosted session's sidecar claims and "delivers"
  (emit == stdout flush) messages the host never surfaces, destroying them under
  at-most-once. The fix adds a per-owner **ObserverLease** to daemon state: a
  human-facing launcher (`org up` / an admin-minted secretary via the new
  `mint_token(observer=True)` opt-in) asserts a lease and receives a
  non-replayable `observer_secret`, injected into the child env
  (`ORG_BROKER_CHANNEL_OBSERVER`) and **never** into the persisted mcp-config;
  only a sidecar presenting the current secret may bump the generation while a
  lease is active, and a config-replay fork is refused with `unobserved` and
  stands down. Owners with no active lease (child panes) keep the legacy
  last-register-wins path, so existing push delivery is not regressed. As an
  interim guard for (B), the sidecar honours an explicit
  `ORG_BROKER_CHANNEL_BG_HOSTED` marker: when set it registers `bg_hosted`, the
  daemon journals `delivery_suppressed_bg_hosted`, refuses to bump the
  generation, and the sidecar stands down. No heuristic bg detection
  (`isatty` / process-tree) is used -- unknown is always treated as foreground so
  a misclassification never stops delivery. The lease is **armed**
  (never-expiring) until the first observed register activates it, then governed
  by TTL + poll heartbeat, so a slow secretary boot cannot let it lapse before
  the first claim. `list_peers` now reports per-agent `receive_mode`
  (`push`/`pull`) instead of the constant `push` for diagnosability. *Out of
  scope:* Phase 3 host-accept gating on confirm (Issue #81 family) -- the
  emit == stdout-flush boundary means (B) cannot be fully closed without a
  host-accept signal, tracked in a follow-up.

- `dispatcher`: the `delegate-plan` helper now accepts **Herdr** pane handles
  (runtime Issue #133). The Herdr backend's `list_panes` emits pane ids of the
  form `w<workspace>:p<pane>` (e.g. `"w1W:p2"`, `"w_live:p2"`), which
  `_parse_pane_id` rejected as an unrecognised pane id -- so **every**
  Herdr dispatch fell back to manual degraded mode. The handle is now recognised
  alongside the existing renga numeric (`1`, `"2"`) and tmux (`"%0"`) formats and
  reduced to its trailing pane number (the deterministic `choose_split`
  tie-breaker), restoring the automated spawn path on the Herdr backend.

- `terminal` + `broker`: org-spawned role panes (worker / dispatcher) and the
  root secretary TUI now **inherit the workspace virtualenv** (`VIRTUAL_ENV`
  plus `.venv/bin` on `PATH`), so venv-assuming tooling no longer breaks inside
  them (runtime Issue #130). Injecting the adapter env dict alone was
  insufficient: tmux (`new-session -e`) and herdr (`agent.start` `env`) pass it
  as the *parent* environment, and the pane's login-shell profile then rebuilds
  `PATH` and drops `.venv/bin`. So on POSIX the `PATH` prepend now runs **after**
  profile init via a post-profile login-shell wrapper
  (`login_shell_venv_wrapper`), while native Windows uses the env dict with
  `%PATH%` and resolves `argv[0]` against the venv `Scripts` dir via
  `shutil.which`. New `terminal/base.py` helpers (`find_workspace_venv` --
  `cwd/.venv` preferred, `root_cwd/.venv` fallback; `venv_bin_dir`;
  `login_shell_venv_wrapper`; `venv_pane_prep`) are a complete no-op when there
  is no `.venv` (conda etc. untouched). The wrapper uses `$SHELL` only when it is
  POSIX-family (else `/bin/sh`, so a fish/csh login shell cannot break the
  launch) and `cd`s back to the pane's own cwd after profile init (so a profile
  ending in an unconditional `cd` cannot relocate the agent out of its worktree).
  `Broker` now holds `root_cwd` (from `serve --root-cwd`) to anchor the prep.
  (Follow-up hotfix #137 made the #130 tests portable on native Windows CI --
  test-only, no production change.)

## [0.1.35] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- `broker`: session **fork/resume** no longer silently loses push-delivered
  messages (runtime Issue #125). A `claude --fork-session --resume` replays the
  original `--mcp-config`, spawning a **second channel sidecar with the same
  delivery credential**; the two sidecars raced `/poll-claims` and each message
  was claimed+confirmed by whichever polled first, so rows destined for the other
  (often the background fork) were recorded `delivered` but never surfaced to the
  session the human was watching. Delivery creds are now **session-scoped
  fenced**: a sidecar calls the new `POST /claim-owner` at startup, which bumps
  the owner's monotonic *delivery generation* and registers that process's
  `instance_id` as the sole current-generation claimer (and immediately requeues
  any older-generation `CLAIMED` rows to `UNDELIVERED`, no lease-expiry wait).
  Every `/poll-claims` and `/confirm-delivered` now carries `generation` +
  `instance_id`; older generations are rejected with `stale_sidecar` (both for
  claim issuance and for confirming a row claimed before the newer sidecar
  registered), so exactly one sidecar drains an owner and the double-claim loss is
  gone. The daemon also emits `duplicate_sidecar_detected` (once per instance-pair
  per lease window) when it observes two live instances polling one owner, and
  `delivery_dump` now exposes per-owner `generations` / `instances` for diagnosis.
  The existing PULL fallback (`check_messages`), mode-epoch (PUSH/PULL) fencing,
  lease reaping, and renga / worker / dispatcher delivery are unchanged. *Known
  limitation:* fencing guarantees a single consistent claimer (the last session to
  register); which forked session is the human-visible foreground is a Claude Code
  session-focus concern and out of scope for this fix.

- `broker` + `terminal`: a `broker send` from a CLI subprocess inside a pane
  now reaches a daemon started with a **non-default `--state-dir`** (runtime
  Issue #122). Previously the subprocess resolved the sidecar under the default
  `.state/broker` and silently missed the real queue. Three coordinated changes:
  (1) the broker injects `ORG_BROKER_STATE_DIR` (its **absolute** state dir) into
  every pane it spawns via a new `env=` argument on the `TerminalAdapter.spawn`
  contract — propagated per backend (`tmux new-session -e` / a WezTerm argv env
  prefix / the `herdr` `agent.start` `env` param), and into the root secretary
  launched by `org up`; (2) `broker send`'s `--state-dir` now resolves in the
  order **flag > `ORG_BROKER_STATE_DIR` env > default `.state/broker`** (the
  parser default became a `None` sentinel so an explicit flag is distinguishable
  from omission); (3) when an unreachable sidecar records a dead pid, the stderr
  diagnostic appends an actionable `stale sidecar? pass --state-dir or set
  ORG_BROKER_STATE_DIR` hint (best-effort pid liveness lives in `sidecar.py`).
  The `broker send` exit contract is unchanged (non-zero = undelivered). The
  `ORG_BROKER_STATE_DIR` name is a contract shared with the `claude-org-ja`
  consumer and must not be renamed. `docs/cli.md` gains a `broker send` section.

- `broker` + `terminal.herdr`: `org up --backend herdr` on **native Windows**
  no longer degrades into a 20s no-info sidecar timeout (runtime Issue #120).
  The `herdr` backend needs a stdlib `AF_UNIX` Unix domain socket, which native
  Windows lacks, so the daemon died on boot and `org up` only surfaced the
  timeout. A single source-of-truth helper `backend_unavailable_reason(backend)`
  in `terminal/base.py` now drives both the `org up` launcher fail-fast (before
  any daemon spawn, ahead of the stale-sidecar / conflict checks) and
  `HerdrAdapter.__post_init__` (the direct `broker serve --backend herdr` path),
  so both fail immediately with the **same actionable ASCII message** (cp932-safe)
  pointing at `--backend wezterm` / WSL / the renga transport. `org up` also now
  distinguishes an *unknown* backend from one *unsupported on this platform*.

### Changed

- `terminal.herdr`: the Windows-unavailable adapter error is now an ASCII-only
  English message (previously contained `§` and Japanese text, which cannot be
  encoded on a cp932 console). `docs/cli.md` and `README.md` document the
  `herdr` POSIX / WSL-only constraint.

## [0.1.34] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- `terminal.herdr` + `broker`: implement the Herdr backend **workspace-layout
  policy** (runtime Issue #110) — *control plane in one space + workers in
  per-project spaces* — on top of the #114/#115 placement fix. Placement strategy
  **C (spawn-then-move)** was confirmed by a probe on live Herdr 0.7.1
  (`investigation/run_layout_probe.sh`): `agent.start` ignores the `workspace`
  parameter (rides along the focused workspace), but `pane.move` can relocate a
  pane cross-workspace into any owned tab (pane_id changes, terminal_id preserved).
  Four scopes:

  - **Isolation boundary set-ification (§4.1/§7.3, BLOCKER invariant).** The
    adapter now tracks two separated sets: a **close-authority owned set**
    (`_spaces`, only workspaces it `workspace.create`d with its own generation
    label — the only workspaces it may `workspace.close`) and a
    **liveness-tracking registry** (`_owned_panes`, each spawned pane's real
    placement). A **self-ownership gate** ensures a diverged pane that rode along a
    *foreign* (human / other-org) workspace is `pane.move`d out and never adds that
    workspace to the close-authority set. `list_panes` unions the owned workspaces,
    gates on the registry (primary) + adapter-managed tab (per-workspace single-tab
    invariant), and a single degraded workspace no longer empties the others.

  - **Spawn-time space selection, 3-layer relay (§6).** `TerminalAdapter.spawn`
    gains an optional `space: SpaceDescriptor` and a `supports_space_layout`
    capability flag (Herdr=True; tmux/wezterm unchanged — the broker branches via
    `getattr`, flat backends keep the exact old signature). The broker computes the
    `SpaceDescriptor` from `role` + a new optional `project` field (control roles →
    `control`; worker+project → `project:<slug>`; projectless worker →
    `project:_unassigned`). Surface amendment is **flag-only** (not ratified, §10).

  - **Generation identity + startup stale sweep (§5).** Workspaces are labelled
    `{prefix}/{org_instance_id}/g{gen}/{space_key}` with a collision-resistant
    persisted `org_instance_id` and a write-ahead-persisted monotonic `generation`.
    On daemon boot the adapter sweeps its own prior-generation orphan workspaces
    (single-live-daemon lock, foreign orgs / humans never touched), supplying the
    cleanup #112 deferred to #110.

  - **Lazy space creation + empty-space cleanup (§4.3/§7.4).** Project spaces are
    created lazily and swept (`workspace.close`) when their last owned pane exits;
    the control space is org-lifetime (never ephemeral-swept). Root-pane cleanup is
    gated on verified placement (probe 6e auto-close avoidance), with in-flight /
    grace guards and a `DEGRADED → GONE` bounded escape.

## [0.1.33] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- `terminal.herdr` + `broker`: fix the Herdr backend's **workspace-isolation
  collapse and consequent false-reap** of live, `agent_registered` dispatcher
  panes (runtime Issue #114). The v0.1.32 (#112) reap gates were only a *delay*
  against a *constant* absence, not a cure: the real root cause is that Herdr
  0.7.1 `agent.start` **ignores the `workspace` / `tab` parameters and places the
  agent in the currently-focused workspace** (the user's), so the adapter's
  dedicated-workspace isolation was a no-op on every spawn and the live pane never
  appeared in the adapter's strict `workspace_id`-filtered `list_panes` — the
  reaper then read that structural absence as "gone" and actively closed a healthy
  pane. Two independently-guarding fixes, both idempotent (they verify the actual
  landing and only fire when it diverged, so a future Herdr that honors the
  parameters does not regress):

  - **Placement reconciliation via `pane.move` (primary).** After `agent.start`,
    `HerdrAdapter.spawn` reads the pane's actual landing workspace from the
    response and, **only when it diverged** from the dedicated workspace, issues
    `pane.move` to relocate the pane into the dedicated tab — **before** the root
    shell pane cleanup (closing root first would auto-close the now-empty dedicated
    workspace and destroy the move target). The pane's `terminal_id` is preserved
    across the move (the Claude process is not restarted), and the returned
    `PaneRef` carries the post-move `pane_id`. `pane.move` was chosen over the
    alternative pre-`agent.start` `workspace.focus` (Fix-A) because it never steals
    focus: it does not flicker the user's TUI on every spawn and cannot race a
    human focus change into landing an agent in a user workspace. If the corrective
    move fails, the stranded pane is best-effort closed and the error is propagated
    (spawn fails cleanly) rather than returning an isolation-broken `PaneRef`.

  - **Workspace-independent authoritative liveness (defense, mandatory
    companion).** `HerdrAdapter` gains `pane_liveness(pane_id, terminal_id)`,
    which the reaper consults (via `getattr`) before deleting a candidate's
    bookkeeping. It resolves the pane directly with `pane.get(pane_id)` — which is
    **not** workspace-filtered — and compares the recorded `terminal_id`:
    `alive` (present + `terminal_id` matches) never reaps; `gone`
    (`pane_not_found`) reaps the bookkeeping with no physical close needed;
    `reused` (present but `terminal_id` differs, i.e. the `pane_id` was reused by a
    foreign pane) reaps the bookkeeping but **never issues a physical close** — so
    a dead dispatcher's recycled `pane_id` can neither false-reap an unrelated user
    pane nor defer forever and resurrect the ghost name bindings that #106/#112
    closed; `unknown` (backend unreachable) defers. This replaces the inverted
    "blindly `pane.close` then judge liveness by whether the close succeeded" logic
    for Herdr with an authoritative pre-check (no more closing a live pane just to
    learn it was alive). `terminal_id` now threads through
    `PaneRef` → `_register_pane` → the pane registry.

  - **tmux / wezterm are unchanged.** Both lack `pane.get` / `terminal_id`, so
    `getattr(adapter, "pane_liveness", None)` returns `None` and the reaper keeps
    the previous physical-close-verification path; `PaneRef.terminal_id` defaults
    to `None`. The isolation guarantees for `org down` / `list_panes` /
    `close_pane` (no touching of panes outside the dedicated workspace) are held —
    the rejected rebind-onto-user-workspace approach is not used.

## [0.1.32] - 2026-07-03

> The paired `claude-org-ja` follow-up for this release is a runtime **pin
> floor bump only** — no `org_extension_schema` / `DEFAULT_NOTIFY` / attention
> vocabulary changes ship here, so ja needs no schema-drift or classifier
> co-update. It runs in a separate PR alongside this release.

### Added

- `broker.send_keys` / `terminal`: the `send_keys` **named-key vocabulary is
  expanded** to the Surface 1.9 contract — `Esc`, the arrow keys, `Shift+Tab`,
  `Home`/`End`, `PageUp`/`PageDown`, `Delete`, and `Ctrl+A`..`Ctrl+Z` — beyond
  the previous `Enter` / `Ctrl+C` / literal-text surface. The existing
  `Enter` / `Ctrl+C` / literal-text paths are unchanged (backward compatible).
  - `terminal.keys`: new module holding the single source of truth for the
    canonical key vocabulary plus alias normalization (`normalize_key`; unknown
    names are rejected at the surface with `-32602`). A drift test pins the
    three-way invariant (alias targets ⊆ canonical, every backend map ⊆
    canonical) so the vocabulary cannot silently fork across backends.
  - `TerminalAdapter` gains a batch `send_named_keys(pane_id, keys)` and a
    `supported_named_keys` ClassVar declaring the canonical subset each backend
    can emit; `type_text` / `send_enter` / `send_interrupt` are untouched.
  - `broker.send_keys_to` preflights the **entire** key batch against
    `supported_named_keys` before emitting anything: if even one key is
    unsupported the whole call is rejected with `[key_unsupported]` (no partial
    keystrokes), and the send order stays `text -> keys -> enter`.
  - Backend coverage: **tmux** maps the full canonical vocabulary to its tmux
    key names (`BTab` / `BSpace` / `DC` / `PPage` / `NPage` / `Escape` …);
    **Herdr** advertises the subset measured against a real server
    (`delete` / `home` / `end` / `pageup` / `pagedown` return `invalid_key`, so
    they are excluded); **WezTerm** advertises `{enter, ctrl+c}` only and
    validates the batch all-or-nothing (a mixed batch emits nothing rather than
    typing the supported prefix). This supersedes the 0.1.16 known limitation
    where valid keys such as `Shift+Tab` returned `[key_unsupported]` on tmux.

### Fixed

- `broker` + `terminal.herdr`: fix a compound blocker where the Herdr backend's
  opportunistic reap falsely reaped live, still-booting panes and left orphan
  TUIs (runtime Issue #109). Three root causes are addressed:

  - **Deterministic pane-unit reap model.** The entry reap
    (`_reap_stale_managed_panes`) no longer equates "absent from the adapter
    snapshot" with "physically gone". Each managed pane now tracks
    `spawned_at` / `last_seen_at` / `missing_since` / `missing_count`, and a
    pane is only a reap candidate once its age exceeds `reap_min_age_seconds`,
    it has been missing for `reap_min_missing_snapshots` snapshots, **and** it
    has been continuously missing for at least `reap_min_missing_seconds` of
    wall-clock time. The wall-time gate is the cadence-insensitive core: because
    the broker drives reap from concurrent request threads, a call-count alone
    could be crossed by several near-simultaneous reap calls within a *single*
    snapshot-lag window and falsely kill a live pane — the elapsed-time gate
    cannot be, since it does not advance no matter how many times reap is
    called. These thresholds are backend-aware (read off the adapter via
    `getattr`): tmux / wezterm keep the previous immediate reap (`0.0` / `1` /
    `0.0`), while `HerdrAdapter` sets conservative values (`12.0s` / `3` /
    `6.0s`) because its `pane.list` is eventually consistent (a live pane can
    transiently drop out during boot / under snapshot lag). This protects the
    display-vs-reservation symmetry without loosening the strict `workspace_id`
    filter.

  - **Physical-close verification on reap.** Before deleting a pane's
    bookkeeping, reap now **always issues a physical close** (via the new
    `HerdrAdapter.kill_pane_detailed` when available, else `kill_pane`) rather
    than gating on a pre-close existence probe. This is deliberate: for Herdr,
    `pane_exists` is backed by the same eventually-consistent `pane.list`, so a
    live-but-hidden pane reads "absent" there too — trusting it would drop
    bookkeeping without ever closing the residual TUI. Issuing the close
    unconditionally is idempotent (already-gone panes return `already_gone` /
    `pane_not_found`) and cannot orphan. The bookkeeping is then dropped **only
    when the close outcome (`closed_via`) confirms the pane is gone**
    (`pane.close` / `workspace.close` / `already_gone` / `kill_pane`); if the
    close is refused (`refused`) or the backend is unreachable
    (`list_failed` / `error`), the metadata/token are kept and the reap is
    deferred (journaled `pane_reap_deferred`) for a later round, so a live TUI
    is never left unmanaged and a backend blip never triggers a false reap. The
    close path + residual are journaled under `pane_reaped`. This fixes the
    original design gap where `_cleanup_pane` never called adapter I/O, so a
    falsely reaped Herdr pane kept running unmanaged.

  - **Same-name respawn burst dampener.** `_reserve_name` now rejects a name
    that has been spawned more than `respawn_burst_threshold` times within
    `respawn_burst_window` (default `5` / `10s`) with `[respawn_flood]`, a
    lightweight guard against launcher-retry × reap amplification producing
    same-name orphans. The retry-limit / backoff proper remains the launcher's
    responsibility (tracked in Issue #109); this is only a broker-side safety
    valve and normal human spawn / close→respawn flows pass through untouched.

  `HerdrAdapter.kill_pane` keeps its `-> None` `TerminalAdapter` contract
  (the detailed variant is additive), so tmux / wezterm are unaffected and all
  existing tmux tests stay green. Workspace generation-identity and stale
  workspace sweep are intentionally **out of scope** here and handled by the
  layout-policy work in Issue #110.

## [0.1.31] - 2026-07-03

> A paired `claude-org-ja` follow-up (runtime pin floor bump / `pane-layout.md`
> + `--free-panes` prose / `max_concurrent_workers` 導線) is running in a
> separate PR alongside this release.

### Added

- `terminal.herdr`: new `HerdrAdapter`, a third `TerminalAdapter` backend
  built on the [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) Socket API (newline-delimited JSON
  over a Unix domain socket, stdlib only — no new dependency). Selectable via
  `--backend herdr` / `ORG_BACKEND=herdr`; wired into `VALID_BACKENDS`,
  `make_adapter()`, the CLI `--backend` choices, and the launcher's
  `_BACKEND_ADAPTER_CLASS` (`isolated_session=True`, so `org down` treats it
  like tmux). The adapter holds one **dedicated Herdr workspace** and lists /
  closes only panes in it (strict `workspace_id` filter), so unrelated Herdr
  panes never leak into `list_panes`. Raw Herdr error codes are normalized at
  the adapter boundary into `cwd_invalid` / `name_in_use` / `adapter_unavailable`
  (Herdr socket unreachable) / `pane_not_found` / `invalid-params` rather than
  passed through; `cwd` is validated *before* any layout mutation. Geometry for
  balanced-split comes from `pane.layout` in terminal cell units, so the
  existing `choose_split` works unchanged.

  **Scope / not yet supported** (follow-ups, see design
  `herdr-adapter.md`): this is the current minimal `TerminalAdapter` surface
  only. Events-buffer normalization (poll_events cursor / 30s cap /
  `events_dropped`) is out of scope — Herdr `events.subscribe` is per-pane and
  drops silently under backpressure, so it needs per-pane subscribe + polling
  reconcile plus a broker-surface change; the adapter uses no events. Full
  raw-key `send_keys` (Shift+Tab / arrows / Home/End …) is also out of scope
  (needs a broker-surface change); only Enter / Ctrl+C / literal text are
  emitted, matching current broker capability. **POSIX/WSL only** — Windows
  named pipe is unsupported and raises `adapter_unavailable` at instantiation.

  **Known limitation (parity with tmux, broker-surface follow-up):** Herdr
  native pane handles are non-digit (e.g. `w1:p2`), like tmux (`%3`). The
  broker's `resolve_target` only treats all-digit strings as raw handles, so a
  pane is addressable by its stable *name* or `focused`, but not by its raw
  non-digit handle. `org down` closes managed panes by the id it lists, so
  closing herdr panes by raw id has the same gap tmux already has; the adapter
  is faithful to the tmux precedent. Making `close_pane` resolve non-digit
  managed handles is a broker-layer change (out of this adapter's scope) that
  would fix tmux and herdr together.

- `dispatcher.runner`: split-capacity is now **backend-aware** (Issue #99).
  `build_plan(..., transport="renga"|"broker")` and the CLI `--transport`
  flag select the capacity model; the transport is passed in explicitly
  (resolved from `ORG_TRANSPORT` / the transport descriptor by the caller)
  and is **never** inferred from the `list_panes` snapshot shape. Under the
  broker transport each pane is an independent detached session, so the
  rect-based `choose_split` geometry ceiling is bypassed and concurrency is
  capped by an explicit `CapacityPolicy`
  (`build_plan(..., capacity_policy=)` + CLI
  `--max-concurrent-workers N|unlimited`). The default is a finite ceiling
  of `8`; `unlimited` is an explicit opt-in; `0` disables spawning. The
  broker spawn addresses a stable adapter-resolvable target
  (`"focused"`/`"vertical"`) instead of a geometry-derived balanced target.
  `count_active_workers(panes, live_worker_names=)` reconciles the active
  worker count against registry liveness so a stale pane cannot permanently
  consume a slot. `ActionPlan.capacity` reports the broker free-slot count.

### Changed

- `dispatcher.runner`: the `split_capacity_exceeded` status name is
  preserved for both backends, but the **broker** escalation message now
  reports `max_concurrent_workers` reached (with `active_workers` /
  `free_worker_slots=0`) instead of the renga rect/MIN_PANE/adjacency
  reason, which was a misdiagnosis on the broker path. renga behaviour and
  the `split_capacity_exceeded` contract name are unchanged.
- `broker.placement`: marked **deprecated / renga-only**. The broker path
  no longer routes through `choose_split`, so this thin balanced-split
  wrapper is a renga-only vestige retained for the import-contract test.

### Follow-up (paired ja-side release, out of scope here)

  This runtime change needs a paired `claude-org-ja` documentation update,
  to ship together with the runtime release:
  - `.claude/skills/org-delegate/references/pane-layout.md` still describes
    balanced split as transport-neutral/load-bearing and "no fixed ceiling,
    split down to MIN_PANE"; under the broker default that prose is stale.
  - work-discovery `--free-panes` should be read as "free worker slots"
    (broker: `max_concurrent_workers - active_workers`; renga: rect-derived).
    The flag name stays for compatibility. Version bump / PyPI publish are
    **not** part of this task.

## [0.1.30] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- `settings`: `generator.py` now emits `sandbox.filesystem.denyRead` /
  `denyWrite` as the contract's list-of-strings (absolute path or glob)
  instead of the internal structured-dict shape. Claude Code's settings
  schema rejected the dict form, so `/doctor` reported "Expected string,
  but received object" for every anchor entry. A new
  `_kept_entry_string()` helper folds a *kept* entry's resolved anchor +
  substituted path into a concrete absolute path/glob at emit time (raw
  strings pass through; a malformed `anchor='absolute'` + relative path
  is left as the dict for launcher / drift CI to surface). No deny is
  lost: `layer2Fallback` is already mirrored into `permissions.deny`, and
  the internal dict model (suppression metadata, `--explain`, `$comment`)
  is preserved untouched. Conforms to
  `docs/contracts/sandbox-launcher-contract.md` §2.1 / §6.4. Closes
  `claude-org-runtime#97`.

## [0.1.29] - 2026-06-18

Hard rename of the tmux backend's dedicated tmux socket (and its generated
session / buffer names) from the historical `claude-org-spike` to
`claude-org-broker`, plus the backend-selection env var `SPIKE_BACKEND` ->
`ORG_BACKEND`, retiring the last `spike`-era naming debt. No backward
compatibility, no env fallback.

### BREAKING

- `terminal.tmux`: the dedicated tmux socket is renamed from
  `claude-org-spike` to `claude-org-broker` (`tmux -L claude-org-broker`),
  and the module constant `SPIKE_SOCKET` is renamed to `BROKER_SOCKET`. A
  `TmuxAdapter` built by this release talks to a different socket than a
  `0.1.28` adapter, so a `0.1.28` process and a `0.1.29` process **do not
  share a tmux server** and cannot see each other's panes. Generated names
  follow: detached sessions are now `claude-org-broker-{pid}-{n}` (was
  `spike-{pid}-{n}`) and paste buffers are `claude-org-broker-buf-{pid}-{n}`
  (was `spike-buf-{pid}-{n}`). Importers of
  `claude_org_runtime.terminal.tmux.SPIKE_SOCKET` must switch to
  `BROKER_SOCKET`. Consumers in `claude-org-ja` (e.g. `org-attach`) are
  migrated in a follow-up task pinned to this version.
- `terminal.base`: the backend-selection env var is renamed from
  `SPIKE_BACKEND` to `ORG_BACKEND` (aligned with `ORG_TRANSPORT`), with no
  fallback. `default_backend()` now reads `ORG_BACKEND`; `SPIKE_BACKEND` is no
  longer consulted, so a caller that set `SPIKE_BACKEND` to force a backend
  silently falls back to the OS default until they switch to `ORG_BACKEND`.

### Changed

- `terminal` / `broker`: module-header provenance comments are de-inverted to
  reflect the real source of truth -- the runtime modules are the current
  canonical implementation, and `claude-org-transport-lab spike/*` is recorded
  as the historical origin they were ported from (was phrased as if the spike
  were the canonical implementation). Comment-only; no behavior change.

## [0.1.28] - 2026-06-16

Epic `suisya-systems/claude-org-ja#586` keystone release: the default
transport flips to `broker` and a transport-neutral `broker send` notify
CLI lands.

### Added

- `broker`: `claude-org-runtime broker send --to <agent_id> --message
  <text>` -- a transport-neutral, best-effort notify CLI that enqueues one
  message to a running broker daemon from a plain subprocess (the
  `mcp__org-broker__send_message` MCP tool is callable only inside a Claude
  Code session, so the CLI discovers the daemon, mints a throwaway admin
  token, and drives a single MCP send). Frozen CLI contract (depended on by
  `suisya-systems/claude-org-ja#590`): `exit 0` = enqueued, non-`0` =
  undelivered (sidecar absent / auth fail / peer not found / unreachable).
  Never raises; emits only short ASCII stderr diagnostics and never echoes
  the message body. Sidecar-absent is a no-op non-`0`, symmetric to the
  `renga` `RENGA_SOCKET`-unset no-op. The shared localhost HTTP client is
  factored out of `broker/launcher.py` into `broker/rpc.py` so the control
  plane and the notify helper reuse one implementation. Closes
  `claude-org-runtime#93` (PR `claude-org-runtime#94`). Refs
  `suisya-systems/claude-org-ja#590`.

### Changed

- `transport`: the default transport is promoted from `renga` to `broker`
  (`claude_org_runtime.transport.DEFAULT_TRANSPORT`). With no
  `ORG_TRANSPORT` set, `resolve_transport(env={})` now returns `broker`
  and every transport-aware surface (e.g. `settings.generator`'s
  `transport_allowlist`) resolves to the `mcp__org-broker__*` tier
  surface. `renga` is **not** removed: set `ORG_TRANSPORT=renga` to fall
  back to the bit-equivalent `mcp__renga-peers__*` surface (opt-in
  fallback). Refs Epic
  `suisya-systems/claude-org-ja#586` (Phase 2 / PR-2), implemented in PR
  `claude-org-runtime#92`, contract amendment ratified in
  `suisya-systems/claude-org-ja#588`.

## [0.1.27] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- `dispatcher`: `delegate-plan` / balanced-split now ingests a
  broker-native `list_panes` snapshot without a hand remap. Two
  broker/renga incompatibilities are reconciled at the pane-parse
  boundary: `Pane.from_dict` accepts the broker's `w` / `h` as aliases
  for renga's `width` / `height` (a key missing under both names still
  raises the malformed-geometry input error), and `_parse_panes` skips a
  broker logical pane — matched by the exact shape the broker emits for
  human-driven surfaces (non-numeric string `id` handle, explicit
  `kind=null`, and the integer `w=h=0` sentinel geometry) — instead of
  crashing the whole snapshot. All four markers are required, so
  genuinely malformed input still raises a clean `exit 1`. Closes
  `claude-org-runtime#89`. Refs `suisya-systems/claude-org-ja#580`.
- `broker`: the `org-broker-channel` push primary-delivery sidecar is now
  wired into the `secretary` (root) launch path, not only the child
  (dispatcher / worker) spawn path. `admin_mint_token` gains a strictly
  bool-validated `channel` parameter that, when true, adds an
  owner-scoped `org-broker-channel` entry to the returned `mcp_config`
  and issues a delivery-scoped credential; the control-plane probe /
  `down` tokens leave `channel` unrequested so throwaway tokens never
  leak an unused credential. `_mint_secretary` requests `channel=true`
  and `build_up_argv` appends the dev-channel flag whenever the config
  carries `org-broker-channel`, keeping the flag subordinate to the
  config to prevent drift. Push primary now reaches the secretary
  directly instead of only via the `check_messages` queue drain. Closes
  `claude-org-runtime#90`.

## [0.1.26] - 2026-06-14

### Changed

- `terminal`: the WezTerm backend now consolidates child panes
  (dispatcher / worker) into tabs of a single anchor window instead of
  opening a standalone window per child. The first child opens a new
  window and `WezTermAdapter` records its `window_id` as the anchor;
  subsequent children spawn as tabs into that window
  (`wezterm cli spawn --window-id <anchor>`, which is mutually exclusive
  with `--new-window`). If the anchor window is killed, the next spawn
  fails the liveness check and falls back to `--new-window`, re-anchoring
  on the new window. `new_window=False` callers are unaffected. Keeps the
  worker fleet from scattering windows during real-machine dogfood.
  Closes `claude-org-runtime#86`. Refs `suisya-systems/claude-org-ja#576`.

## [0.1.25] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- `terminal`: the WezTerm backend no longer flashes a console window on
  Windows. `wezterm.exe` is a GUI-subsystem binary, so every `wezterm cli`
  invocation — fired on each monitoring poll and message exchange — spawned
  a flickering window. `WezTermAdapter._cli` now passes
  `creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW` on Windows (`os.name == "nt"`)
  to suppress it.

## [0.1.24] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- `broker`: channel `meta.sent_at` is now stringified before it reaches
  the host channel schema, stopping a silent-drop where the float epoch
  failed the host's string-typed `sent_at` validation and the channel
  message was dropped without surfacing an error. Closes
  `claude-org-runtime#80` (PR #82).

## [0.1.23] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Push primary-delivery core: a per-channel sidecar plus the daemon-side
  delivery lifecycle, landing the first end-to-end push primary-delivery
  path. Closes `claude-org-runtime#74` (PR #75).

### Fixed

- Broker nudge misroute silent-drop under renga <-> broker coexistence:
  the nudge tool name is now fully qualified and `--strict-mcp-config` is
  injected so nudges resolve to the broker surface instead of being
  silently dropped. Closes `claude-org-runtime#76` (PR #77).

## [0.1.22] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- `org up`: the interactive secretary TUI is now launched with
  `ORG_TRANSPORT=broker` injected into its child environment, so the
  secretary (and everything it spawns) resolves the broker transport
  surface instead of silently falling back to the default `renga`.
  Closes `claude-org-runtime#70` (PR #72).

- README: documented `org up` / `org down` and the broker control
  plane. Refs `claude-org-runtime#63` (PR #71).

## [0.1.21] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- `org up` / `org down`: a thin session launcher wrapped around the broker
  control plane (sidecar contract + admin RPC from PR #67). It re-uses the
  control-plane logic rather than re-implementing it.
  - `org up` decides whether to **reuse** a running daemon on
    *reachability*, not PID liveness: it reads the `daemon.json` sidecar,
    mints a `secretary`-tier root token over the admin RPC, and confirms an
    MCP `initialize` -> `tools/list` round-trip. If the admin port is
    unreachable (stale sidecar) it starts a fresh daemon in the background
    (POSIX: detached session; Windows: `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP |
    DETACHED_PROCESS`), discovering the actual port from the freshly
    published sidecar (the child's stdout is never depended on). A *live*
    daemon whose backend differs from the requested one is reported as a
    conflict (`org down` first) instead of silently spawning a second
    daemon over the same `state_dir`. If a `secretary` is already
    registered on a live daemon, `org up` is a no-op ("already up") rather
    than launching a second, mis-named secretary. The reuse health probe
    mints an **unnamed** (auto-unique) token for its `initialize` ->
    `tools/list` round-trip — never the named `secretary` — so a
    backend-conflict or unhealthy-MCP failure can never leave a
    `name="secretary"` orphan that would brick the next `org up` with
    `name_taken`; the probe session is de-registered via the MCP `DELETE`
    when done. (Known limitation: the probe leaves a de-registered,
    not-revoked bind in the daemon's in-memory table, cleared on daemon
    shutdown — the control plane exposes no token-revoke RPC and this
    launcher does not add one.)
  - The minted secretary's `--mcp-config` is written to
    `<state-dir>/secretary-mcp.json` with mode `0600` (atomic
    temp -> `os.replace`, mirroring the `admin.token` publish). The
    interactive `claude` TUI argv is built **only** through the existing
    billing-neutral `surface.build_claude_argv`, so headless flags
    (`-p` / `--print` / ...) cannot leak into the launch. POSIX `exec`s the
    TUI; Windows launches it as a subprocess and falls back to printing the
    one-line command when the `claude` binary is not found.
  - `org down` discovers the daemon from its sidecar, mints its **own**
    auto-unique control token (never `name="secretary"`, which would
    collide with the live secretary it is tearing down), closes residual
    broker panes, requests a **signal-free** `shutdown` over the admin RPC,
    and verifies `broker_stopped` appears exactly once in the
    `journal_offset` slice for this run (avoiding whole-history grep false
    positives) before cleaning up the sidecar. The pane-close scope is
    chosen by the running daemon's backend (read from the sidecar via the
    adapter's `isolated_session` ClassVar): on an **isolated** backend
    (tmux — `list_panes` only ever shows broker-owned panes) every pane is
    closed regardless of `kind`, so generic `spawn_pane` panes (e.g. the
    attention watcher) are cleaned up too; on a **global-mux** backend
    (wezterm — `list_panes` also returns unrelated panes) the close is
    limited to `claude` / `codex` agent children to avoid collateral
    kills. The broker's own `close_pane` still enforces the `last_pane`
    guard and logical-pane refusal. Absent sidecar is a no-op.
  - All entry paths absolutize their `state_dir` / `root_cwd` up front
    (`sidecar.absolutize`, combining `posixpath.isabs` to avoid the Windows
    `isabs` trap). `broker serve` is unchanged.

## [0.1.20] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- `dispatcher delegate-plan`: now accepts tmux-style `%N` pane IDs (e.g.
  `%3`) wherever a pane ID is expected, in addition to the existing
  numeric / name forms. A malformed pane ID is rejected with a clean
  `exit 1` (one-line error) instead of a Python traceback. Closes
  `claude-org-runtime#60` (PR #64).
- `broker`: `spawn_claude_pane` / `spawn_codex_pane` / `spawn_pane` now
  resolve a **relative** `cwd` against the **caller pane's** cwd before
  handing it to the terminal adapter, matching the documented renga
  contract (absolute paths used as-is; relative resolved against the
  caller pane's cwd). Previously the relative path was passed straight to
  the adapter, where `tmux new-session -c` re-resolved it against the
  daemon/server base — in the `#515` broker dogfood this dropped the
  `dogfood/` segment and landed the dispatcher in the wrong tree. The
  caller's cwd is the broker bind's `cwd`, and the **resolved absolute**
  cwd is what is now stored in the pane registry, so a child's own
  relative spawns anchor correctly down the tree. When a relative `cwd` is
  requested but the caller's cwd is unknown (e.g. a logical root pane
  registered without a cwd), the spawn is **rejected deterministically**
  (`[cwd_unanchored]`, invalid-params) rather than silently resolved
  against the daemon's base. Absolute-path detection accepts both POSIX
  and native-absolute forms so canonical POSIX paths (`/repo`) are honored
  as absolute regardless of the daemon platform. Closes
  `claude-org-runtime#61`.

### Added

- `broker serve --root-cwd <dir>` (default: the daemon's launch directory,
  `os.getcwd()`): gives the manually-launched root pane (the human-driven
  secretary) a cwd in its bind, so relative-`cwd` spawns from that pane
  have a deterministic resolution anchor. The documented operating
  contract is that the daemon is launched from the session root; pass
  `--root-cwd` explicitly when launching from elsewhere. This is the
  root-cause companion to the `#61` fix: the dogfood secretary's bind cwd
  was `null`, leaving relative spawns with no anchor.

## [0.1.19] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- `broker`: the terminal adapter now advertises an `isolated_session`
  capability flag, exposing whether the backend spawns panes in an
  isolated session so callers can branch on session-isolation support
  instead of assuming it.

### Fixed

- `broker`: the root secretary is now registered as a logical pane in the
  broker registry. Previously the root agent had a bind but no pane
  registry entry, so it never appeared in `list_panes`, and `close_pane`
  mis-counted the live panes and could trip the last-pane guard. Closes
  `claude-org-runtime#57` (PR #58).

## [0.1.18] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- `broker serve --root-role {worker,curator,dispatcher,secretary}`
  (default `worker`): the manual-verification token issued by
  `broker serve` was previously pinned to the worker tier (`issue_token`
  hard-coded `"worker"`), so there was no CLI path to bind the root agent
  at the secretary (or any other) tier. The new flag flows into the issued
  token's `auth_role`, so `tools/list` is structurally narrowed to that
  tier's surface. `default=worker` keeps the current behavior unchanged
  (messaging 4 面). Token issuance is extracted into `issue_root_token()`
  so the `--root-role → auth_role → 公開面` boundary is unit-testable
  independently of the blocking `serve` loop. The `--mcp-config` display
  and the billing-neutral `spawn` guard are unchanged. Closes
  `claude-org-runtime#53` (PR #54).

## [0.1.17] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- `transport`: new subpackage holding the **transport surface descriptor**
  (ja-migration-plan §5.2 (i) / §5.3 / §3.1) — the single SoT mapping a
  transport `flag` (`renga` | `broker`) to its concrete wiring:
  `{server 名, spawn 注入 flag, role tier -> MCP tool 名集合}`. Additive,
  flag-aware API consumed (via pin) by both the runtime `settings/generator`
  and the ja-side generators (`tools/gen_delegate_payload.py` / worker_brief),
  so the transport prefix / tool set lives in one place instead of being
  hardcoded per generator (drift 防止).
  - `renga`: server `renga-peers`, injection
    `--dangerously-load-development-channels server:renga-peers`, **全ロール
    一様の required 14 面** (`tools/check_renga_compat.py` REQUIRED_MCP_TOOLS /
    renga 0.18.0 と一致; renga には構造的 tier gating が無いため一様)。
  - `broker`: server `org-broker`, injection `--mcp-config <broker>`,
    **role tier 別** (secretary 13 / dispatcher 12 / worker・curator 4)。
    tier 別集合は `claude_org_runtime.broker.surface` の `tools_for` から
    導出 (ハードコード二重管理を避ける — drift lock test 付き)。
  - Public surface: `get_surface` / `resolve_transport` (explicit >
    `ORG_TRANSPORT` env > default `renga`) / `tools_for_role` /
    `allow_entries_for_role` / `TransportSurface`.
- `settings.generator.transport_allowlist(role, *, transport=None, env=None)`:
  descriptor-driven, flag-aware MCP allowlist projection. With the default
  `renga` flag the emitted `mcp__renga-peers__*` entries are **bit-equivalent
  with the current shared surface** (§5.3 non-breaking guarantee, regression
  test included); `ORG_TRANSPORT=broker` yields the tier-appropriate
  `mcp__org-broker__*` set. The transport is read from `ORG_TRANSPORT`
  (env-only flag, §5.1 — no persisted config file so no Set C amendment).

### Notes

- Default transport stays `renga` (`ORG_TRANSPORT` unset ⇒ current behavior
  unchanged). The broker default-flip (§8 Issue G) is a post-dogfood human
  decision and is **not** made here.
- Scope is runtime-only: ja-side wiring (pin bump / `gen_delegate_payload.py`
  / worker_brief / golden) is ja#513 and prose/contract revisions are ja#514;
  release publish (git tag / PyPI) + paired ja sync are coordinated by the
  desk and intentionally **not** performed in this change.

## [0.1.16] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- `broker`: new subpackage porting the `claude-org-transport-lab`
  `spike/broker.py` org-broker (Phase 4/5 で確定した MCP surface +
  allowlist guard + session 検証) into `claude_org_runtime/broker/`,
  split into four responsibilities — `surface` (MCP 面: PROTOCOL_VERSIONS /
  SERVER_INFO / TOOLS / ToolArgError / `dispatch_tool`), `tokens`
  (`AgentBind` + `TokenMixin`), `store` (`StoreMixin`: queue 永続化 +
  JSONL journal), and `server` (`Broker` orchestrator: localhost HTTP MCP
  server + nudge delivery + `_McpHandler`). The single-lock concurrency
  contract (nudge double-injection check-and-set / DELETE deadlock
  avoidance) is carried over unchanged. Nudge delivery lives in `server`,
  not `store`, so queue persistence and PTY injection stay decoupled.
- `broker`: queue journal is now written to `.state/broker/queue.jsonl`
  (CWD-relative default; the spike wrote to its self-contained
  `spike/broker-state/`).
- `broker serve`: new daemon CLI entry, exposed both as
  `claude-org-runtime broker serve ...` and
  `python -m claude_org_runtime.broker`.
- `broker.placement`: thin one-way reuse of
  `dispatcher.runner.choose_split` (`list_panes(dict) -> Pane.from_dict ->
  choose_split`) for balanced-split placement. Pure-function wrapper only;
  it is intentionally NOT wired into spawn (the terminal adapter exposes no
  split-target surface — that deeper integration is tracked separately).
  Dependency direction is one-way: `broker -> terminal` / `choose_split`;
  `claude-org-ja` does not import `broker` (flag-gated, inactive by default
  under renga).
- `schema.broker_queue_event_schema()`: Contract Set C amendment for
  `.state/broker/` — a bundled JSON Schema (Draft 2020-12) for a
  `queue.jsonl` line. `ts` is a float epoch (`time.time()`), distinct from
  `journal_event`'s ISO8601 string timestamp.
- `broker`: pane-control MCP surface brought to the renga-peers **golden
  shape** (Issue C / Epic #6 next stage C — drop-in form-difference-zero).
  The catalogue grows from the 4 messaging tools to the 13-tool golden shape:
  the 12 ported faces (`send_message` / `check_messages` / `list_peers` /
  `set_summary` / `list_panes` / `inspect_pane` / `send_keys` / `poll_events`
  / `close_pane` / `set_pane_identity` / `spawn_claude_pane` / `spawn_pane`)
  **plus the newly added `spawn_codex_pane`**. `new_tab` / `focus_pane` are
  intentionally excluded from the initial surface (human-judgment).
- `broker`: structured `spawn_claude_pane` / `spawn_codex_pane` builders
  assemble the interactive-TUI argv inside the broker (Claude gets the broker
  MCP injected via `--mcp-config <token>` instead of renga's dev-channel
  flag). The billing-neutral guard is now a **default-deny allowlist on the
  broker's own builder output** (not caller-argv inspection), closing the
  false-reject surface: value-flags carry arity, `argv[0]` is matched by
  basename, and subcommands / bare positionals / `--` / unknown or headless
  flags are rejected. `spawn_codex_pane` structurally restricts to the
  interactive TUI — `exec` / `review` / `mcp-server` / `app-server` /
  `exec-server` / `apply` / `sandbox` / `completion` and any other
  subcommand are default-denied (mandatory test coverage).
- `broker`: pane addressing resolves three ways (`Broker.resolve_target`) —
  all-digit string → handle, non-digit string → stable name, `'focused'` →
  focused pane — matching renga's addressing.
- `broker`: `list_peers` / `list_panes` now carry **cwd** (kept in the broker
  bind / pane registry at spawn time, since `tmux capture-pane` does not
  expose it). `receive_mode` is the constant `"pull"` (broker delivery is
  uniformly pull via `check_messages`; a Set D amendment vs renga's
  push/poll distinction) and `kind` reflects the spawned client
  (`"claude"` / `"codex"` / `null`).
- `broker`: `set_pane_identity` gains renga three-state semantics
  (omit = keep / `null` = clear / string = set) for `name` / `role`. The
  display `role` is decoupled from an immutable `auth_role`: **tier gating
  (§4.2) is decided by `auth_role` only**, so renaming a pane's display role
  cannot escalate its privileges (Issue B codex Blocker carried forward as an
  intentional security strengthening).
- `broker`: role-scoped tool exposure (`tools/list` and dispatch are filtered
  by `auth_role`) — worker / curator see messaging only; dispatcher adds the
  pane-control tools; secretary additionally gets the generic `spawn_pane`
  (attention-watcher launch). Reaching a tool outside one's tier is rejected
  structurally, not by permission config.

### Changed

- `broker`: `list_peers` output gains `cwd` / `kind` / `receive_mode` fields
  (additive; existing `id` / `name` / `role` / `summary` unchanged).

### Known limitations

- `broker`: this stage establishes the **surface shape** (catalogue + schemas
  + builders + guards + target resolution + cwd parity + three-state
  identity); the terminal adapter's native capabilities are out of scope and
  tracked for Epic #6 next stage (#4, full backend adapter). Concretely:
  directional split is accepted for shape parity but `adapter.spawn` opens a
  new window/session (no in-place split); `send_keys` validates the full
  renga key vocabulary (unknown names → `-32602`) but only emits the keys the
  current adapter supports (literal text / Enter / Ctrl+C) — other valid keys
  (e.g. Shift+Tab) return `[key_unsupported]`; `poll_events` is served from a
  broker-internal lifecycle ring (spawn / close) rather than native backend
  events; and `spawn_codex_pane` does not yet inject the broker MCP into Codex
  (renga relies on a `RENGA_PEER_CLIENT_KIND` env that `adapter.spawn` cannot
  set today). `claude-org-ja` is untouched (flag-gated, inactive under renga).

## [0.1.14] - 2026-06-09

### Changed

- `dispatcher.choose_split`: `_ROLE_PRIORITY` を反転し、**dispatcher を最優先
  分割ターゲット (priority=4)、secretary を最低優先 (priority=1)** に変更。
  worker は dispatcher ペインを垂直分割して spawn されるようになり (curator=3 >
  worker=2 は従来の相対順を維持)、secretary の content viewport は last-resort
  までは分割されない。
- dispatcher の viewport 保護ロジックを再構成。従来は「last-resort の dispatcher
  を curator priority へ昇格させる freed-curator-zone reclaim」だったが、
  dispatcher が常時最優先になったため、垂直分割で残る左 child が
  `DISPATCHER_MIN_WIDTH`(=80) 以上の間だけ最優先を保ち、それを下回ると新定数
  `_DISPATCHER_NARROW_PRIORITY`(=0、全ロール未満) へ降格して active 監視ペインが
  繰り返し半減されないよう self-limit する方式に変更。dispatcher の
  adjacency gate (resident curator 非隣接時のスキップ) は不変。

## [0.1.13] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- `dispatcher.choose_split`: curator のオンデマンド化 (claude-org-ja #503)
  で dispatcher が吸収した「旧 curator スロット」の空きスペースが balanced
  split のターゲット選定で考慮されず、bottom zone が無駄になっていた問題を
  修正。curator 不在かつ dispatcher の垂直分割で残る左 child が新定数
  `DISPATCHER_MIN_WIDTH`(=80) 以上のとき、その垂直分割を curator の
  role-priority スロットに昇格させ、下位 priority の worker を半減させる前に
  空きスペースを worker zone として埋める。`DISPATCHER_MIN_WIDTH` フロアが
  self-limit として働き、dispatcher が快適幅まで縮んだ後は last-resort に
  戻るため active 監視ペインの viewport が繰り返し半減されることはない。
  既存の #35/#36 挙動 (curator 不在時の last-resort 候補化・両方向評価・
  resident-curator レイアウト) は不変。

## [0.1.12] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- `dispatcher.choose_split`: curator オンデマンド化後に通常サイズの端末で
  `None` (`SPLIT_CAPACITY_EXCEEDED`) を返していた問題を修正。curator 不在時に
  dispatcher を last-resort 候補に含め、両方向を min-size fallback 付きで
  評価、`SECRETARY_MIN_WIDTH` を 140→120 に。Closes `claude-org-runtime#35`
  (PR #36).

## [0.1.11] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- `attention.classifier`: new `notify_sent.kind = "awaiting_user"`
  subkind maps to attention kind `secretary_awaiting_user` at default
  `urgent` severity. Designed to fire when the secretary is waiting on
  user input at the 3 canonical gates — worker completion approval,
  CI-green merge approval, and escalation reply forward. Refs
  `claude-org-runtime#28` (PR #30).
- `attention.platform`: WSL attention backend now invokes
  `wsl-notify-send.exe` when the binary is on `PATH`, producing real
  Windows toast notifications instead of the previous
  `Write-Host` no-op. Original `wsl` PowerShell backend retained
  bit-for-bit as a fallback when the binary is absent. Beep dispatched
  as a separate `powershell.exe` call so toast delivery is independent
  of sound playback. Closes `claude-org-runtime#25` (PR #27).
- `attention.config`: `pending_decisions` TTL ladder. Two new knobs —
  `pending_decision_max` (default 1440 minutes / 24h, urgent → normal
  demote) and `pending_decision_drop` (default 10080 minutes / 7d,
  suppress to `--json-only`) — applied symmetrically to both
  `pending_decision` and `user_reply_not_forwarded` attention kinds.
  `AttentionEvent.suppressed` flag added so callers can distinguish
  the drop-to-json-only tier from active dispatch. Closes
  `claude-org-runtime#26` (PR #29).

### Changed

- `attention.classifier` `DEFAULT_NOTIFY` severity rebalance: 6
  anomaly subkinds demoted from `urgent` to `normal` —
  `relay_gap_suspected`, `silent_worker_output`, `pane_silent`,
  `worker_stalled`, `worker_not_reported`, `worker_error`. `urgent`
  is now reserved for action-required moments only:
  `approval_blocked`, `pending_decision`,
  `user_reply_not_forwarded`, `ci_failed`, `pane_crashed`. Closes
  `claude-org-runtime#26` (PR #29).

## [0.1.10] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- `claude_org_runtime.attention`: new top-level package implementing the
  attention / notification watcher per `claude-org-ja`
  `docs/design/attention-notification.md` §5 / §6 (merged ja PR #443,
  2026-05-12). Closes `claude-org-runtime#19` and `claude-org-runtime#20`.
  - New CLI subcommand family mounted on the top-level
    `claude-org-runtime` entry point:
    - `claude-org-runtime attention scan --state-dir DIR [--dry-run]
      [--json]` — one-shot pass over `state.db` events + pending
      decisions, classifies and (unless `--dry-run`) dispatches a
      notification per anomaly, dedup'd against prior runs.
    - `claude-org-runtime attention watch --state-dir DIR
      [--config PATH]` — long-running poll loop with backend probing
      and config-driven template / severity overrides.
  - `attention.classifier`: pure events / pending → `AttentionEvent`
    mapping. Covers the 3 design-doc subkinds plus the production
    `notify_sent.kind` vocabulary: every `schema.AnomalyKind` enum
    (`pane_silent` / `pane_crashed` / `worker_stalled` /
    `worker_not_reported`) and the dispatcher prompt's freeform
    `error` tag (`prompts/templates/dispatcher.md` line 410). All
    map to urgent attention with bundled English titles that templates
    may override.
  - `attention.config`: `AttentionConfig` dataclass + JSON loader
    (`load_config`). Operators may override per-`kind` severity via a
    `notify` map (e.g. `{"worker_completed": "urgent"}`) which now
    reaches the emitted `AttentionEvent.severity` — the classifier
    accepts a `notify_map` parameter instead of hard-coding severity.
  - `attention.notify`: template render + truncation + subprocess
    dispatch. `_placeholders` enforces a flat identifier allowlist —
    attribute / index forms like `{summary[0]}` or
    `{summary.__class__}` are rejected before reaching `format_map`,
    so templates cannot reach into arbitrary `AttentionEvent`
    internals. `_strip_control` also drops DEL (0x7f) per its
    docstring intent. `max_title` / `max_body` truncation is applied
    post-render.
  - `attention.platform`: macOS / Linux / Windows / WSL / stdout
    backend probing. Windows / WSL PowerShell commands gate the
    `[console]::beep(800,200)` invocation on `play_sound=True` so
    `sound="off"` actually silences the watcher on those platforms;
    when both sound and the visible PowerShell host stream are
    suppressed the dispatch downgrades to intentional stdout-only
    delivery (`desktop_intended=False`) so `reached_user` stays
    honest. macOS / Linux paths now also ring the terminal bell on
    successful `osascript` / `notify-send` delivery so the §5 urgent
    sound row actually fires (visual-only delivery was the previous
    behaviour).
  - `attention.dedup`: atomic JSON state with corruption recovery —
    a malformed dedup file is treated as empty rather than crashing
    the watcher.
  - `attention.readers`: `state.db` (sqlite3, `events` table) and
    `pending_decisions.json` readers. Both tolerate corruption:
    `read_events` traps `sqlite3.Error` so a non-SQLite / corrupt
    `state.db` does not crash a long-running watch loop, matching
    the pending-decisions reader posture. `_minutes_since` returns
    `+inf` for missing or malformed ISO timestamps so the pending
    classifier alerts on a corrupt `received_at` / `user_replied_at`
    instead of silently treating the entry as "0 minutes old" —
    false-positive is the right error direction for a relay-gap
    watcher.
  - Dedup contract: an event is only marked delivered when something
    actually reached the user. Desktop subprocess success OR bell
    fallback OR explicit stdout-only / desktop-disabled mode all
    count; a silently-failing `notify-send` (non-zero returncode)
    retries on the next poll instead of being dedup'd into oblivion.
    `_dispatch_desktop` runs subprocesses with `check=False` and
    inspects the returncode itself.
  - `attention scan --json` payload reports the rendered title /
    body from `FormattedNotification` (post-template, post-truncation)
    plus a `delivered` boolean mirroring `reached_user`. Machine
    consumers (notably the planned `claude-org-ja#445` golden test)
    can now tell a classified event from one that actually reached
    the user without re-implementing the dispatch contract.
  - `attention` CLI wraps `load_config` in `_load_cfg_or_exit` so a
    malformed config JSON produces a one-line error + exit code 2
    instead of a Python traceback.

### Notes

- Tests under `tests/attention/` cover every §5 / §6 acceptance
  criterion — backend selection across all 5 platforms (macOS / Linux
  / Windows / WSL / stdout), dry-run subprocess suppression, dedup
  recovery from broken JSON, template unknown-placeholder fallback,
  `max_title` / `max_body` truncation, the dedup-retry contract on
  desktop-dispatch failure, PowerShell beep gating, malformed-config
  CLI error path, missing / malformed ISO timestamp handling, and a
  Japanese template smoke test (109 attention tests, 292 tests
  total).
- Tag-triggered release workflow at `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  builds sdist + wheel and publishes to PyPI via OIDC Trusted
  Publisher, then attaches artifacts to the GitHub Release. PyPI
  publication is out of worker scope; the `v0.1.10` tag push
  triggers it.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- `claude_org_runtime/settings/role_configs_schema.json`: schema mirror
  sync from `claude-org-ja` Phase 2 worker git guardrails
  (Refs `claude-org-ja#379`, paired with ja PR #420
  `feat/phase2-worker-git-guardrails-impl`). Brings the runtime-bundled
  schema back into byte-equivalence with ja's
  `tools/org_extension_schema.json` so
  `tools/check_runtime_schema_drift.py` passes inside ja's pin window.
  - `roles.worker`:
    - `required_allow`: drop `Bash(git worktree:*)` (worktree creation
      now denied at the worker layer).
    - `required_deny`: add the dangerous-git family — `Bash(git worktree)`
      / `Bash(git worktree *)`, `Bash(git fetch)` / `Bash(git fetch *)`,
      `Bash(git pull)` / `Bash(git pull *)`, `Bash(git submodule)` /
      `Bash(git submodule *)`, `Bash(git lfs)` / `Bash(git lfs *)`,
      `Bash(git gc)` / `Bash(git gc *)`,
      `Bash(git filter-branch)` / `Bash(git filter-branch *)`,
      `Bash(git filter-repo)` / `Bash(git filter-repo *)`,
      `Bash(git replace)` / `Bash(git replace *)`,
      `Bash(git update-ref)` / `Bash(git update-ref *)`,
      `Bash(git config --global *)`, `Bash(git config --local *)`,
      `Bash(git config --worktree *)`.
    - `required_hooks`: attach `block-dangerous-git.sh` and
      `block-no-verify.sh` on the `Bash` matcher (alongside the
      existing `block-git-push.sh` / `block-org-structure.sh`).
    - `disallow_allow_regex`: add `^Bash\(git worktree.*\)$`.
  - `worker_roles.default` and `worker_roles.claude-org-self-edit`:
    - `permissions.allow`: drop `Bash(git worktree:*)`.
    - `permissions.deny`: add the same dangerous-git family as
      `roles.worker` plus the `git -C <dir>` variants, the `git remote
      add|set-url|remove|rm` family (with `-C` variants), and the
      `git reflog expire|delete` family (with `-C` variants).
    - `hooks.PreToolUse[matcher=Bash]`: attach
      `block-dangerous-git.sh` and `block-no-verify.sh` after
      `block-git-push.sh`. `worker_roles.default` keeps
      `block-org-structure.sh` last; `worker_roles.claude-org-self-edit`
      retains its existing org-structure carve-out (no
      `block-org-structure.sh` on the self-edit role by design).

### Notes

- Runtime evaluator behaviour is unchanged. This release ships only
  the schema surface needed for ja's Phase 2 worker git guardrails so
  ja's drift CI passes once the runtime pin window widens to include
  `0.1.9`.
- Concrete `sandbox` / `sandbox_by_pattern` bodies remain ja-side
  policy and are not bundled with the runtime; the byte-drift check
  strips both sides' bodies before comparison
  (`_strip_ja_only_sandbox_bodies` in
  `tools/check_runtime_schema_drift.py`).
- Tagging, GitHub release, and PyPI publish are handled secretary-side
  post-merge (see `knowledge/curated/release-process.md`).

## [0.1.8] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- `claude_org_runtime.settings.generator`: Phase 3 case E — extend WSL
  detection markers and emit sandbox suppression `$comment` metadata
  (Refs `claude-org-ja#392`, `claude-org-ja#389`).
  - `_detect_wsl` now matches `Microsoft` / `WSL` in `/proc/version`
    (covers WSL1 `Linux version 4.4.0-19041-Microsoft` and WSL2
    proc/version-only detection paths) in addition to the historical
    `microsoft-standard-WSL` marker on `/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease`,
    per `phase3-bootstrap-policy-design.md` §5.2(a).
  - `$comment` is emitted on the rendered settings whenever the runtime
    suppressed at least one Layer 3 `sandbox.filesystem.denyRead` /
    `denyWrite` entry. Format follows
    `sandbox-launcher-contract.md` §2.1:
    `platform=<linux|wsl>, layer-3 entries suppressed: [<list>]`. The
    launcher's `/sandbox` status surface parses the fixed prefix to
    discover the suppressed set without re-deriving it. Structured
    anchor entries render as `<anchor>:<path>`; legacy raw strings
    render as-is. Layer 2 `permissions.deny` is untouched per design
    §5.2(b).
  - `settings show` text mode now surfaces the `$comment` line in both
    bare and `--explain` modes so operators get an at-a-glance
    suppression summary even without `--explain`'s full per-entry
    block. JSON mode already exposed it via `payload['settings']`.
  - Documentation: `render_role` docstring now distinguishes between
    `$comment` keys dropped from input role specs vs. the suppression
    `$comment` the runtime adds to the rendered output.
  - `_normalize_sandbox_entry` docstring clarifies that legacy raw
    `~/...` strings are NOT auto-expanded — operators wiring
    home-relative case E suppression must use the structured
    `{anchor: 'home', path: ...}` form (Phase 1 backward-compat
    decision).

### Notes

- Realpath-escape suppression on `sandbox.filesystem.denyRead` /
  `denyWrite` itself is unchanged from 0.1.4; this release ships only
  the metadata + observability surface alongside the broadened WSL
  detection markers.
- Out of scope (deferred per `claude-org-ja#392` task brief): case A
  bootstrap fallback (launcher-side, `sandbox-launcher-contract.md`
  §3), `failIfUnavailable` redefinition (pends case A), and the
  `/sandbox` status output (claude-org-ja territory).

## [0.1.7] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- `claude_org_runtime.settings.generator`: Pattern A/B/C-aware sandbox
  selection on worker roles (Refs `claude-org-runtime#13`).
  - `worker_roles[<role>].sandbox_by_pattern: {A?, B?, C?}` declares
    one sandbox surface per dispatch pattern. The pattern keys are
    exactly `A` / `B` / `C` (matching the resolver / delegate-payload
    normalization in claude-org-ja). The generator picks
    `sandbox_by_pattern[--pattern]` and treats it as the role's
    sandbox; missing pattern keys are an authoring error rather than
    a silent fallthrough so Pattern B's distinct
    `additionalDirectories` / `base_clone` surface is never replaced
    by an A/C surface (Codex Blocker 1).
  - `sandbox` and `sandbox_by_pattern` are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE on
    worker roles; declaring both surfaces a `ValueError`. Org roles
    (`roles[<role>]`: secretary / dispatcher / curator) keep the
    single `sandbox` shape and may NOT declare `sandbox_by_pattern`
    (Codex Major 1).
  - `_VALID_ANCHORS` gains `base_clone` so Pattern B sandbox entries
    can reference Git metadata via
    `<base_clone>/.git/worktrees/<task_id>`,
    `<base_clone>/.git/objects`, etc. (Codex Blocker 3; contract
    SoT: claude-org-ja's
    `docs/contracts/role-pattern-sandbox-contract.md` §4.2.1, not
    redistributed here). `anchor='base_clone'` without a generator
    `base_clone` context surfaces a usable error message pointing at
    `--base-clone`.
  - CLI: `--pattern` is now `choices=('A','B','C')` so typos like
    `--pattern b` fail fast instead of falling through silently
    (Codex Nit 1).
  - Pattern B's *command-isolation* guardrails (`Bash(git worktree *)`
    deny + `block-dangerous-git.sh`) are intentionally NOT modeled in
    `sandbox_by_pattern`. The runtime sandbox layer is path-isolation
    only; command isolation lives in the per-role `permissions.deny`
    / `.hooks` (handled by the paired claude-org-ja Phase 1 PR4 --
    Codex Major 3).

### Notes

- Backward-compatible: roles using the legacy single `sandbox` shape
  render unchanged, and `--pattern` stays informational on those
  roles.
- Pattern C sub-modes (ephemeral vs gitignored_repo_root) are out of
  scope for this PR; `sandbox_by_pattern.C` captures only the
  surface common to both sub-modes.
- This release does not ship concrete
  `worker_roles[*].sandbox_by_pattern` bodies. The paired
  claude-org-ja Phase 1 PR4 lands the concrete bodies, plumbs
  `--pattern` / `--base-clone` / `--task-id` / `--branch-ref` through
  `tools/resolve_worker_layout.py` / `tools/gen_delegate_payload.py`,
  and updates `tools/check_runtime_schema_drift.py` to render A/B/C
  fixtures. Until that PR lands, the runtime CLI exposes the surface
  but the standard dispatch path does not yet exercise it.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- `claude_org_runtime.settings.generator`: Phase 1 sandbox schema +
  generator extension (Refs `claude-org-ja#378`, `claude-org-ja#376`).
  - Structured anchor entry shape on
    `sandbox.filesystem.denyRead` / `denyWrite`. Each entry may now be
    either a legacy raw string (anchored at `worker_dir` for relative
    paths, treated literally for absolute paths) or a structured object
    `{anchor: 'home'|'worker_dir'|'claude_org_path'|'absolute', path:
    string, suppressOnSymlinkEscape: bool, default true}`. The
    structured form fixes the prior ambiguity where home-anchor
    entries (`~/.aws/**`) were misjudged as `worker_dir`-relative.
    Existing string entries continue to parse via the legacy adapter
    (`_normalize_sandbox_entry`) so no consumer migration is required.
  - `render_role_with_metadata(..., role_kind='org'|'worker')`: callers
    can now render the org-side roles (`schema['roles'][...]`) in
    addition to the worker-side templates (`schema['worker_roles'][...]`).
    Default is `'worker'` for backward compatibility.
  - Pattern B context parameters (`base_clone`, `task_id`, `branch_ref`,
    `pattern`) on both `render_role` and `render_role_with_metadata`.
    Their `{...}` placeholders are substituted alongside `{worker_dir}`
    / `{claude_org_path}` in entry paths and `additionalDirectories`
    before realpath evaluation.
  - Per-entry `suppressOnSymlinkEscape: false` opt-out: a structured
    entry with this flag is preserved in the rendered output even when
    its realpath escapes the sandbox read roots (e.g. for entries the
    operator wants surfaced for the launcher regardless of
    reachability).
  - `GeneratorContext` dataclass and `_VALID_ANCHORS` constant exported
    as the canonical generator inputs.
  - CLI: `claude-org-runtime settings generate` and `settings show`
    now expose `--role-kind {worker,org}`, `--base-clone`, `--task-id`,
    `--branch-ref`, and `--pattern` so the new generator surface is
    reachable from the public command-line entry point as well.
    `settings generate --role-kind org` is rejected (org
    `settings.local.json` files are hand-maintained); use `settings
    show --role-kind org` for inspection.
- `docs/cli.md`: documented the new `--role-kind` / `--base-clone` /
  `--task-id` / `--branch-ref` / `--pattern` flags on both `settings
  generate` and `settings show`, plus the org-rejection behavior.
- `claude_org_runtime.settings.role_configs_schema.json`: documented
  the new structured anchor form via
  `worker_roles.$comment_sandbox_anchor` and added
  `roles.$comment_roles_sandbox` permitting the same `sandbox` shape on
  org-side roles (secretary / dispatcher / curator).

### Notes

- The matching `claude-org-ja`-side schema surface, drift CI extension,
  and pin bump are tracked separately as a follow-up after this
  runtime release lands.
- Concrete sandbox bodies for `roles.secretary` / `roles.dispatcher` /
  `roles.curator` are deliberately NOT populated in this PR. Phase 0
  contract (`docs/contracts/role-pattern-sandbox-contract.md` on the
  `claude-org-ja` side) is the SoT for which entries each org role
  declares; this PR is limited to the structural extension (schema +
  generator + CLI). The matching ja-side follow-up PR populates the
  bodies driven by that contract.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-10

### Changed

- `claude_org_runtime/settings/role_configs_schema.json`: add
  `Write(*/.worktrees/*/.claude/settings.local.json)` and
  `Edit(*/.worktrees/*/.claude/settings.local.json)` to the secretary
  role's `required_deny`. Extends Secretary's `permissions.deny`
  coverage to the `live_repo_worktree` (Pattern B) sub-mode where the
  worktree lives under `{claude_org_path}/.worktrees/...` rather than
  `{workers_dir}/{project_slug}/.worktrees/...`. The existing
  `*/workers/*/.worktrees/*/.claude/settings.local.json` pattern only
  covered worker-side worktrees; this adds a sibling glob (no
  role-specific gating in the pattern itself, mirroring how the
  existing entry is expressed) so the `claude-org-ja`-side org
  extension schema can pin a runtime release that already carries
  the matching deny coverage. Refs `claude-org-ja#300`,
  `claude-org-ja#289`.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- `claude_org_runtime.settings.generator`: Phase 3 sandbox bootstrap
  policy MVP (case E only, refs `claude-org-ja#392`, `claude-org-ja#376`).
  - `worker_roles.<role>.sandbox` is a new optional object with shape
    `{enabled: bool, filesystem: {denyRead, denyWrite,
    additionalDirectories}, failIfUnavailable: bool}`. Documented via
    the new `worker_roles.$comment_sandbox` schema annotation. Existing
    roles without `sandbox` are unchanged (backward compatible — absent
    `sandbox` is treated as sandbox-disabled).
  - `render_role()` (and a new `render_role_with_metadata()` that
    returns a `RenderResult` carrying the suppression report) now apply
    Layer 3 suppression: each `sandbox.filesystem.denyRead` /
    `denyWrite` entry whose realpath escapes the sandbox read roots
    (`worker_dir` + `additionalDirectories`) is dropped from the
    rendered sandbox object. This handles the WSL case (`/home/<u>/...`
    that resolves into `/mnt/c/...`) and devcontainer case
    (`/workspaces` symlinks) without hard-coding `/mnt/c`. Layer 2
    `permissions.deny Read(...) / Write(...)` entries are NEVER
    suppressed.
  - Annotation-only WSL detection (`/proc/version`,
    `/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease` → `microsoft-standard-WSL`) recorded
    in suppression metadata for telemetry; the actual suppression
    decision is keyed on realpath escape.
- `claude-org-runtime settings show [--explain] [--json]`: new CLI
  surface that drives the same renderer as `settings generate` (single
  source of truth) and surfaces the rendered settings + sandbox
  suppression metadata. With `--explain`, the output includes
  `wsl_detected`, the resolved `sandbox_read_roots`, and the per-entry
  suppression list (`layer`, `entry`, `reason`, `realpath`).

### Deferred (per `tmp/codex-review-phase3-impl-392.md`)

- Case A bootstrap fallback (`bootstrap.py`, bwrap stderr parser):
  runtime does not control the bwrap launcher, so the helper would be
  dead code. Tracked for a follow-up after the launcher contract
  stabilizes.
- `failIfUnavailable` redefinition: kept the field in the schema but
  semantics are unchanged from prior usage.
- `sandbox_deny_skipped` journal events: requires the
  `claude-org-ja` `journal_append` contract, deferred to a separate PR.
- `profile-tightened.json` `$comment` updates and
  `docs/verification.md` reconciliation are `claude-org-ja`-side
  follow-ups for after the runtime release lands.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-09

### Changed

- `claude_org_runtime/settings/role_configs_schema.json`: sync 5 Read deny
  entries from claude-org-ja `feat/phase2-read-deny-gap-rows` (commit
  `68f502e`). Both `worker_roles.default.permissions.deny` and
  `worker_roles.claude-org-self-edit.permissions.deny` now include:
  `Read(.env)`, `Read(.env.*)`, `Read(**/credentials*)`, `Read(**/*.pem)`,
  `Read(~/.config/gh/hosts.yml)`. Closes the Phase 2 Read-tool gap rows
  surfaced by the sandbox-probe iter-c §4.3 #2 audit (Layer 2 perms.deny
  had no Read entries; Layer 3 sandbox.denyRead is Bash-tool-only).
  Refs `claude-org-ja#376`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-06

### Changed

- `dispatcher.runner.choose_split`: align balanced-split target selection
  with claude-org-ja PR #310 (`org-delegate` Step 3-1b /
  `references/pane-layout.md`).
  - `SECRETARY_MIN_WIDTH` 125 → 140.
  - `SECRETARY_MIN_HEIGHT` 45 → 30.
  - `curator` is now a valid split target (previously skipped).
  - Sort regime changed from `(metric desc, id asc)` to
    `(role priority desc, metric desc, id asc)` with priority
    `secretary=4 > curator=3 > worker=2 > dispatcher=1`.
  - Dispatcher's curator-rect adjacency requirement is unchanged.
  - `SplitChoice` gains a `role` field (defaulted to `""`) so the new
    sort key can read it; existing positional construction is not
    affected.
- Regression scenario covered: 280×86 terminal with secretary 280×43
  now correctly selects secretary for the next split (previously the
  secretary was never splittable under the old thresholds).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-03

### Changed

- Maintenance release: trigger first PyPI publish via Trusted Publisher
  (registered post-0.1.0). No code changes from 0.1.0.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-02

First release with a public CLI surface. Marks the completion of
Phase 4's Layer 2 extraction from `claude-org-ja` (refs
`claude-org-ja#129`): the in-tree `tools/dispatcher_runner.py`,
`tools/generate_worker_settings.py`, and `tools/role_configs_schema.json`
can now be replaced by `pip install claude-org-runtime` without
behavioural regression.

### Added

- `claude_org_runtime.dispatcher.runner` (Step D-1): port of
  `tools/dispatcher_runner.py`. Public API: `Pane`, `SplitChoice`,
  `ActionPlan`, `LocaleConfig`, `choose_split`, `build_plan`,
  `validate_task_id`, `validate_cwd`, `validate_instruction_vars`,
  `render_instruction`, `write_instruction`. CLI: `python -m
  claude_org_runtime.dispatcher.runner delegate-plan`. New
  `--template-repo` flag lets callers point the helper at the repo
  hosting `.claude/skills/org-delegate/references/instruction-template.md`;
  default resolution tries the runtime package's ancestors first, then
  walks up from CWD. New `--locale-json PATH` flag lets non-English
  consumers (notably `claude-org-ja`) override the runtime's English
  defaults via a `LocaleConfig` JSON file (`constraints_default`,
  `report_target_default`, `claude_md_filename_default`,
  `instruction_template`).
- `claude_org_runtime.settings.generator` (Step D-1): port of
  `tools/generate_worker_settings.py`. Public API: `load_schema`,
  `render_role`. CLI:
  `python -m claude_org_runtime.settings.generator`. The bundled
  schema is the new SoT.
- `claude_org_runtime.settings.role_configs_schema.json` (Step D-1):
  bundled copy of `tools/role_configs_schema.json` (SoT moved into the
  runtime package).
- `claude-org-runtime` console entry point with `dispatcher` /
  `settings` subcommand groups (e.g.
  `claude-org-runtime dispatcher delegate-plan ...`).
- `docs/cli.md`: CLI usage reference and migration recipe for
  `claude-org-ja` consumers replacing the in-tree `tools/` scripts.
- `claude_org_runtime.prompts` package: bundled English reference prompts
  for the `secretary`, `dispatcher`, and `curator` roles, plus
  `load(role)` / `load_meta(role)` / `available_roles()` (stdlib-only
  frontmatter parser). The templates are reference, not prescriptive —
  consumers override or adapt them from their own `CLAUDE.md`. Refs
  `claude-org-ja#129`.
- `tests/scrub/scrub_fixture.py`: deterministic scrubber for `.state/`
  snapshots (URLs, emails, API keys, session-narrative H2 blocks,
  long worker `note` fields). Preserves structural identifiers
  (`task_id`, `event`, `ts`, `pane_id`, `pane_name`, `status`, `state`).
- `docs/scrub-policy.md`: policy and operational procedure for
  promoting `claude-org-ja` `.state/` snapshots into fixtures.
- `tests/fixtures/synthetic/{scrub_input_sample,expected_output}.jsonl`:
  synthetic round-trip fixture exercising every scrubber class.
- Refs `claude-org-ja#208`.
- `claude_org_runtime.schema` package: `WorkerStatus`, `JournalEventType`,
  `AnomalyKind` (string-mixin Enums), frozen `JournalEvent` dataclass with
  `from_dict`/`to_dict` and an `extra` forward-compatibility bucket, and a
  `parse_worker_directory_registry` parser for `org-state.md` rows.
- Bundled JSON Schema (Draft 2020-12) files for `JournalEvent` and
  `WorkerDirEntry` under `claude_org_runtime.schema.json_schema`.
- `claude_org_runtime.migrate.v1_to_v2` polymorphic migrate (CLI:
  `python -m claude_org_runtime.migrate.v1_to_v2 --in IN --out OUT`):
  legacy keys (`worker`, `pane`, `dir`) are kept alongside canonical keys
  (`task_id`, `pane_id`/`pane_name`, `worker_dir`); unknown event names
  fall back to `event=misc` with `original_event` preserved.
- Synthetic fixtures and tests covering schema validation and the v1->v2
  migrate round-trip.
- Refs `claude-org-ja#129`.

### Changed

- Added `jsonschema>=4.18` as a runtime dependency (sole non-stdlib dep).
- Bumped package classifier from `Development Status :: 1 - Planning` to
  `Development Status :: 4 - Beta`.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-05-02

Initial skeleton (no public API).

- Package metadata in `pyproject.toml` (name `claude-org-runtime`, MIT, py>=3.10).
- `src/claude_org_runtime` package with version SoT in `__about__.py`.
- Smoke test asserting the exposed `__version__`.
- Pytest matrix CI (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) on ubuntu/macos/windows × py3.10–3.12.
- Trusted Publisher release skeleton (`.github/workflows/release.yml`), tag-triggered only.
- README, LICENSE, and `.gitignore`.
